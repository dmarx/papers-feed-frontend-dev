### Detailed Technical Explanations for Researchers' Decisions in Poincaré Embeddings

#### 1. Choice of Hyperbolic Space for Embeddings
The decision to use hyperbolic space for embeddings stems from its ability to naturally represent hierarchical structures. In hyperbolic geometry, distances grow exponentially with respect to the distance from a central point, which allows for a compact representation of tree-like structures. This is particularly advantageous for datasets that exhibit power-law distributions or hierarchical relationships, as hyperbolic space can model these relationships more efficiently than Euclidean space, which requires higher dimensions to capture similar structures.

#### 2. Selection of the Poincaré Ball Model
The Poincaré ball model is chosen due to its suitability for gradient-based optimization. It provides a well-defined Riemannian manifold structure that facilitates the computation of distances and geodesics, which are essential for embedding learning. The Poincaré ball allows for embeddings to be constrained within a bounded region, preventing numerical instability that can arise in unbounded spaces. Additionally, the model's properties enable the representation of multiple hierarchies in higher dimensions, which is crucial for complex datasets.

#### 3. Use of Riemannian Optimization for Learning Embeddings
Riemannian optimization is employed because it respects the geometric structure of the Poincaré ball. Traditional optimization methods may not be effective in non-Euclidean spaces, as they do not account for the curvature of the manifold. Riemannian optimization techniques, such as RSGD (Riemannian Stochastic Gradient Descent), allow for efficient updates of the embedding parameters while ensuring that the embeddings remain within the Poincaré ball, thus maintaining the integrity of the hyperbolic space.

#### 4. Assumption of Latent Hierarchical Structure in Data
The assumption of a latent hierarchical structure is based on empirical observations that many real-world datasets, such as social networks and taxonomies, exhibit hierarchical relationships. By modeling these structures, the embeddings can capture not only the similarity between objects but also their hierarchical relationships, leading to more informative representations. This assumption is particularly relevant for tasks like link prediction and semantic similarity, where understanding the hierarchy can enhance performance.

#### 5. Decision to Operate in an Unsupervised Learning Setting
Operating in an unsupervised learning setting is justified by the nature of the data, which often lacks explicit labels or hierarchical information. The goal is to infer the underlying structure from the data itself, making the approach applicable to a wide range of datasets. This allows for the discovery of relationships and patterns without the need for labeled training data, which can be scarce or expensive to obtain.

#### 6. Design of the Loss Function for Embedding Optimization
The loss function is designed to encourage semantically similar objects to be close in the embedding space while maintaining the hierarchical structure. This typically involves a contrastive loss or a triplet loss that minimizes the distance between similar pairs and maximizes the distance between dissimilar pairs. The choice of loss function directly impacts the quality of the learned embeddings, as it guides the optimization process towards meaningful representations.

#### 7. Dimensionality of the Embedding Space
The dimensionality of the embedding space is chosen based on the complexity of the data and the need to capture multiple latent hierarchies. Higher dimensions provide more flexibility for the optimization process, allowing for better separation of points in the embedding space. However, the dimensionality must be balanced against the risk of overfitting, especially in unsupervised settings where the model may learn noise rather than meaningful patterns.

#### 8. Parallelization Strategy for Optimization
The optimization process is designed to be parallelizable to handle large datasets efficiently. By leveraging mini-batch training and stochastic optimization techniques, the algorithm can update embeddings in parallel across multiple data points. This approach significantly reduces computation time and allows for scalability, making it feasible to learn embeddings from large-scale datasets.

#### 9. Evaluation Metrics for Comparing Embeddings
Evaluation metrics are critical for assessing the quality of the learned embeddings. Common metrics include precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) for tasks like link prediction. For hierarchical tasks, metrics that capture the preservation of hierarchical relationships, such as hierarchical precision and recall, may also be employed. These metrics provide insights into the effectiveness of the embeddings in capturing both similarity and hierarchy.

#### 10. Handling of Missing Data in Embeddings
Handling missing data is essential for real-world applications where datasets may be incomplete. The approach may involve imputation techniques or the use of regularization methods that allow the model to learn robust embeddings despite missing information. By incorporating mechanisms to deal with missing data, the embeddings can still provide meaningful representations, enhancing their applicability.

#### 11. Experimental Validation on Specific Datasets (e.g., WORDNET, Collaboration Networks)
Experimental validation on datasets like WORDNET and collaboration networks is crucial for demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. These datasets are chosen because they exhibit clear hierarchical structures, allowing for a direct assessment of the embeddings'
