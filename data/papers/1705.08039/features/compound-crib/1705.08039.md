## Detailed Technical Explanations and Justifications for Poincaré Embeddings

### Objective of Poincaré Embeddings
The primary objective of Poincaré embeddings is to learn hierarchical representations of symbolic data by embedding them into hyperbolic space, specifically the Poincaré ball. This approach is motivated by the observation that many real-world datasets exhibit hierarchical structures, such as taxonomies or social networks. Traditional Euclidean embeddings often struggle to capture these hierarchies effectively due to their linear nature, which limits their ability to represent complex relationships. By utilizing hyperbolic space, Poincaré embeddings can represent both the hierarchical relationships (through the radial distance from the origin) and the semantic similarity (through the angular distance) of the data points.

### Hyperbolic Geometry
Hyperbolic geometry is a non-Euclidean geometry characterized by constant negative curvature. This property makes it particularly suitable for modeling hierarchical data structures, such as trees, where the number of nodes grows exponentially with their distance from the root. In hyperbolic space, the area of a disk increases exponentially with its radius, allowing for a compact representation of hierarchical relationships. This contrasts with Euclidean geometry, where the area grows polynomially, necessitating higher dimensions to represent similar structures, which can lead to inefficiencies and overfitting.

### Poincaré Ball Model
The Poincaré ball model is defined as:
\[
B^d = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^d | \|x\| < 1 \}
\]
This model provides a bounded representation of hyperbolic space, making it suitable for optimization tasks. The Riemannian metric tensor for the Poincaré ball is given by:
\[
g_x = \frac{2}{1 - \|x\|^2} g_E
\]
where \(g_E\) is the Euclidean metric. This metric allows for the computation of distances in a way that reflects the hyperbolic nature of the space, facilitating the representation of hierarchical relationships.

### Distance Metric
The Poincaré distance between two points \(u\) and \(v\) in the Poincaré ball is defined as:
\[
d(u, v) = \text{arcosh}\left(1 + \frac{2 \|u - v\|^2}{(1 - \|u\|^2)(1 - \|v\|^2)}\right)
\]
This distance metric captures the unique properties of hyperbolic space, where distances grow rapidly as points approach the boundary of the ball. This characteristic is crucial for embedding hierarchical structures, as it allows for a natural representation of the relationships between nodes in a tree-like structure.

### Embedding Strategy
The embedding strategy aims to find a set of embeddings \(\Theta = \{ \theta_i \}_{i=1}^n\) such that semantically similar objects are close in the embedding space. The optimization problem is formulated as:
\[
\Theta \leftarrow \arg \min_\Theta L(\Theta) \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \forall \theta_i \in \Theta: \theta_i < 1
\]
This formulation ensures that all embeddings remain within the Poincaré ball, maintaining the properties of hyperbolic space. The loss function \(L(\Theta)\) is designed to encourage proximity among similar objects, effectively capturing both similarity and hierarchical relationships.

### Optimization Method
To solve the optimization problem, stochastic Riemannian optimization methods, such as RSGD (Riemannian Stochastic Gradient Descent) and RSVRG (Riemannian Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient), are employed. The update rule for RSGD is given by:
\[
\theta_{t+1} = R_{\theta_t}(-\eta_t \nabla_R L(\theta_t))
\]
where \(R_{\theta_t}\) is the retraction onto \(B^d\). This approach leverages the Riemannian structure of the Poincaré ball, allowing for efficient updates that respect the geometry of the space.

### Riemannian Gradient
The Riemannian gradient is derived from the Euclidean gradient \(\nabla_E\) using the inverse of the Poincaré ball metric tensor \(g^{-1}_\theta\). This transformation is essential for ensuring that the optimization process adheres to the geometric constraints of the Poincaré ball, allowing for meaningful updates that reflect the underlying structure of the data.

### Partial Derivative of Poincaré Distance
The partial derivative of the Poincaré distance with respect to an embedding \(\theta\) is crucial for understanding how changes in the embedding affect the distance between points. The expression is given by:
\[
\frac{\partial d(\theta, x)}{\partial \theta} = \frac{4 \beta}{\gamma^
