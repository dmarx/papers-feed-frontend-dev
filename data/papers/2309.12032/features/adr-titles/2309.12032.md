- Decision to use Ancestral Graphs (AGs) as a representation for causal diagrams.
- Choice of Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) for sampling ancestral graphs.
- Adoption of Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) as the scoring function for graph sampling.
- Implementation of an iterative human feedback mechanism in the causal discovery process.
- Decision to model expert knowledge as potentially noisy and uncertain.
- Selection of importance sampling for updating beliefs based on human feedback.
- Choice to focus on scenarios with latent confounding in causal discovery.
- Decision to incorporate uncertainty quantification in the causal discovery output.
- Use of an optimal experimental design for querying experts.
- Decision to validate the approach using synthetic observational data.
- Choice of linear Gaussian structural causal models for the data-generating process.
- Decision to avoid retraining GFlowNets after each human interaction.
- Selection of the negative expected cross-entropy as the utility function for expert queries.
- Decision to sample from a distribution defined by a score function rather than a single graph output.
- Choice to emphasize the importance of expert validation in the causal inference process.
