  "abstract": "Structure learning is the crux of causal inference. Notably, causal discovery\n(CD) algorithms are brittle when data is scarce, possibly inferring imprecise\ncausal relations that contradict expert knowledge -- especially when\nconsidering latent confounders. To aggravate the issue, most CD methods do not\nprovide uncertainty estimates, making it hard for users to interpret results\nand improve the inference process. Surprisingly, while CD is a human-centered\naffair, no works have focused on building methods that both 1) output\nuncertainty estimates that can be verified by experts and 2) interact with\nthose experts to iteratively refine CD. To solve these issues, we start by\nproposing to sample (causal) ancestral graphs proportionally to a belief\ndistribution based on a score function, such as the Bayesian information\ncriterion (BIC), using generative flow networks. Then, we leverage the\ndiversity in candidate graphs and introduce an optimal experimental design to\niteratively probe the expert about the relations among variables, effectively\nreducing the uncertainty of our belief over ancestral graphs. Finally, we\nupdate our samples to incorporate human feedback via importance sampling.\nImportantly, our method does not require causal sufficiency (i.e., unobserved\nconfounders may exist). Experiments with synthetic observational data show that\nour method can accurately sample from distributions over ancestral graphs and\nthat we can greatly improve inference quality with human aid.",
