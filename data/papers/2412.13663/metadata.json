  "abstract": "Encoder-only transformer models such as BERT offer a great performance-size\ntradeoff for retrieval and classification tasks with respect to larger\ndecoder-only models. Despite being the workhorse of numerous production\npipelines, there have been limited Pareto improvements to BERT since its\nrelease. In this paper, we introduce ModernBERT, bringing modern model\noptimizations to encoder-only models and representing a major Pareto\nimprovement over older encoders. Trained on 2 trillion tokens with a native\n8192 sequence length, ModernBERT models exhibit state-of-the-art results on a\nlarge pool of evaluations encompassing diverse classification tasks and both\nsingle and multi-vector retrieval on different domains (including code). In\naddition to strong downstream performance, ModernBERT is also the most speed\nand memory efficient encoder and is designed for inference on common GPUs.",
