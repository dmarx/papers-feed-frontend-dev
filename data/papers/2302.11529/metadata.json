  "abstract": "Transfer learning has recently become the dominant paradigm of machine\nlearning. Pre-trained models fine-tuned for downstream tasks achieve better\nperformance with fewer labelled examples. Nonetheless, it remains unclear how\nto develop models that specialise towards multiple tasks without incurring\nnegative interference and that generalise systematically to non-identically\ndistributed tasks. Modular deep learning has emerged as a promising solution to\nthese challenges. In this framework, units of computation are often implemented\nas autonomous parameter-efficient modules. Information is conditionally routed\nto a subset of modules and subsequently aggregated. These properties enable\npositive transfer and systematic generalisation by separating computation from\nrouting and updating modules locally. We offer a survey of modular\narchitectures, providing a unified view over several threads of research that\nevolved independently in the scientific literature. Moreover, we explore\nvarious additional purposes of modularity, including scaling language models,\ncausal inference, programme induction, and planning in reinforcement learning.\nFinally, we report various concrete applications where modularity has been\nsuccessfully deployed such as cross-lingual and cross-modal knowledge transfer.\nRelated talks and projects to this survey, are available at\nhttps://www.modulardeeplearning.com/.",
