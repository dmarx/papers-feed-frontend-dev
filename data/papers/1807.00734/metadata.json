  "title": "The relativistic discriminator: a key element missing from standard GAN",
  "authors": "Alexia Jolicoeur-Martineau",
  "abstract": "In standard generative adversarial network (SGAN), the discriminator\nestimates the probability that the input data is real. The generator is trained\nto increase the probability that fake data is real. We argue that it should\nalso simultaneously decrease the probability that real data is real because 1)\nthis would account for a priori knowledge that half of the data in the\nmini-batch is fake, 2) this would be observed with divergence minimization, and\n3) in optimal settings, SGAN would be equivalent to integral probability metric\n(IPM) GANs.\n  We show that this property can be induced by using a relativistic\ndiscriminator which estimate the probability that the given real data is more\nrealistic than a randomly sampled fake data. We also present a variant in which\nthe discriminator estimate the probability that the given real data is more\nrealistic than fake data, on average. We generalize both approaches to\nnon-standard GAN loss functions and we refer to them respectively as\nRelativistic GANs (RGANs) and Relativistic average GANs (RaGANs). We show that\nIPM-based GANs are a subset of RGANs which use the identity function.\n  Empirically, we observe that 1) RGANs and RaGANs are significantly more\nstable and generate higher quality data samples than their non-relativistic\ncounterparts, 2) Standard RaGAN with gradient penalty generate data of better\nquality than WGAN-GP while only requiring a single discriminator update per\ngenerator update (reducing the time taken for reaching the state-of-the-art by\n400%), and 3) RaGANs are able to generate plausible high resolutions images\n(256x256) from a very small sample (N=2011), while GAN and LSGAN cannot; these\nimages are of significantly better quality than the ones generated by WGAN-GP\nand SGAN with spectral normalization.",
