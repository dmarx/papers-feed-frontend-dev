- **Dataset Overview**: Zyda-2 is a 5 trillion token dataset designed for language model pretraining, built from high-quality open-source datasets like FineWeb and DCLM.

- **Key Innovations**: 
  - **Cross-Deduplication**: Utilizes approximate minhash LSH deduplication with a signature size of 128 and 85% Jaccard similarity threshold, removing ~11% of total tokens.
  - **Model-Based Filtering**: Applied to Zyda-1 and Dolma-CC using a quality-classifier model, significantly improving performance by retaining the top 10-20% of high-quality documents.

- **Dataset Composition**: 
  - Major sources: DCLM (3.850B tokens), FineWeb-Edu (1.319B tokens), Zyda-1 (1.056B tokens), Dolma-CC (1.209B tokens).
  - Final token counts after processing: DCLM (3.348B), Dolma-CC (0.969B), Zyda-1 (0.937B), FineWeb-Edu (1.319B), totaling 5.068B tokens.

- **Performance Evaluation**: 
  - Utilizes annealing training approach for evaluating dataset quality, showing better sensitivity in evaluation scores compared to training small models from scratch.
  - Zyda-2 outperforms leading datasets in aggregate evaluation scores due to enhanced filtering and deduplication.

- **Optimal Weighting Strategy**: 
  - Found that upweighting FineWeb-Edu to match DCLM's proportion improved performance over a uniform weighting scheme.
  - Despite their smaller size, Zyda-1 and Dolma-CC contribute valuable diversity to the dataset.

- **Release Information**: Zyda-2 is released under an open-source license (ODC-BY) and is available at [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Zyphra/Zyda-2).

- **Future Research Directions**: 
  - Investigate when duplication is harmful or beneficial in dataset construction.
  - Explore the robustness of models trained on duplicate data.
