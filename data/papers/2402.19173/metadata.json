  "abstract": "The BigCode project, an open-scientific collaboration focused on the\nresponsible development of Large Language Models for Code (Code LLMs),\nintroduces StarCoder2. In partnership with Software Heritage (SWH), we build\nThe Stack v2 on top of the digital commons of their source code archive.\nAlongside the SWH repositories spanning 619 programming languages, we carefully\nselect other high-quality data sources, such as GitHub pull requests, Kaggle\nnotebooks, and code documentation. This results in a training set that is 4x\nlarger than the first StarCoder dataset. We train StarCoder2 models with 3B,\n7B, and 15B parameters on 3.3 to 4.3 trillion tokens and thoroughly evaluate\nthem on a comprehensive set of Code LLM benchmarks. We find that our small\nmodel, StarCoder2-3B, outperforms other Code LLMs of similar size on most\nbenchmarks, and also outperforms StarCoderBase-15B. Our large model,\nStarCoder2- 15B, significantly outperforms other models of comparable size. In\naddition, it matches or outperforms CodeLlama-34B, a model more than twice its\nsize. Although DeepSeekCoder- 33B is the best-performing model at code\ncompletion for high-resource languages, we find that StarCoder2-15B outperforms\nit on math and code reasoning benchmarks, as well as several low-resource\nlanguages. We make the model weights available under an OpenRAIL license and\nensure full transparency regarding the training data by releasing the SoftWare\nHeritage persistent IDentifiers (SWHIDs) of the source code data.",
