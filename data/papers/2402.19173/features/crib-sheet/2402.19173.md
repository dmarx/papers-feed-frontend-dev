- **Project Overview**: BigCode project focuses on responsible development of Large Language Models for Code (Code LLMs) with the introduction of StarCoder2.
  
- **Data Sources**: The Stack v2 is built on Software Heritage's source code archive (619 programming languages) and includes high-quality data from GitHub pull requests, Kaggle notebooks, and code documentation.

- **Training Set Size**: The training set for StarCoder2 is 4Ã— larger than the first StarCoder dataset, comprising 900B+ unique tokens.

- **Model Parameters**: StarCoder2 models are trained with 3B, 7B, and 15B parameters on 3.3 to 4.3 trillion tokens.

- **Performance Metrics**: 
  - StarCoder2-3B outperforms similar-sized Code LLMs.
  - StarCoder2-15B outperforms DeepSeekCoder-33B on math and code reasoning benchmarks and several low-resource languages.

- **Training Process**: 
  - Two-stage training: base model with a 4k context window, followed by fine-tuning with a 16k context window.
  - Maximum of 5 epochs over the dataset.

- **Data Preparation**: 
  - Deduplication, filtering low-quality code, redacting PII, and handling opt-outs.
  - Basic filters include removing autogenerated files, long lines, and files with low alphabetic character content.

- **License Detection**: 
  - Uses regular expressions to identify license files and applies ScanCode for SPDX ID detection.
  - Classifies files as permissively licensed, non-permissively licensed, or unlicensed.

- **Language Detection**: 
  - Utilizes go-enry for programming language detection, identifying 658 unique languages.

- **GitHub Issues Processing**: 
  - Excludes auto-generated text and comments from bots, retains conversations with two or more users, and anonymizes usernames.

- **Pull Requests Data Collection**: 
  - Aggregates various GitHub events related to pull requests and retrieves corresponding code files from Software Heritage.

- **Transparency and Licensing**: Model weights are available under an OpenRAIL license, with full transparency on training data via Software Heritage persistent identifiers (SWHIDs).
