The research presented in the paper introduces **WideNet**, a parameter-efficient framework for transformer models that emphasizes the concept of "going wider instead of deeper." This approach is motivated by the need to improve parameter efficiency while maintaining or enhancing model performance. Below is a detailed technical explanation of the key concepts, framework, and decisions made by the researchers.

### Key Concept: Go Wider Instead of Deeper

1. **Rationale**: Traditional transformer models often increase depth (i.e., adding more layers) to improve performance. However, this can lead to diminishing returns in terms of performance gains relative to the increase in parameters. The researchers argue that increasing the width (i.e., the number of parameters in each layer) can lead to better performance without the same level of complexity and resource demands associated with deeper architectures.

2. **Parameter Efficiency**: By focusing on width, the model can utilize a larger number of parameters in a more effective manner, allowing for richer representations without the need for extensive depth. This is particularly important for applications with limited computational resources or smaller datasets.

### Framework: WideNet

1. **Parameter Sharing**: WideNet employs parameter sharing across transformer blocks, which allows the model to maintain a lower number of trainable parameters while still benefiting from the increased capacity of wider layers. This is achieved by sharing the mixture-of-experts (MoE) layer across blocks, which enhances the model's ability to learn complex representations.

2. **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Layers**: The MoE layer replaces the traditional feed-forward network (FFN) in transformer blocks. This allows for conditional computation, where only a subset of experts is activated for each input, leading to significant reductions in the number of parameters that need to be trained while still allowing for complex modeling.

### MoE Layer

1. **Conditional Computation**: The MoE layer activates only a few experts for each input, which allows the model to maintain a similar computational cost (FLOPs) as a standard transformer while utilizing a larger number of parameters. This is particularly beneficial for tasks that require diverse representations.

2. **Routing Mechanism**: The researchers implement a routing mechanism using a TopK function to select the top-ranked experts for each input. This is defined mathematically as:
   \[
   g(x) = TopK(softmax(f(x) + \epsilon))
   \]
   where \( f(x) \) is a linear transformation and \( \epsilon \) is Gaussian noise. This approach ensures that the routing remains sparse, allowing for efficient computation.

### Parameter Sharing and Individual Normalization

1. **Shared MoE Layer**: By sharing the MoE layer across transformer blocks, WideNet allows each expert to be trained on a diverse set of token representations, enhancing the model's generalization capabilities.

2. **Individual Normalization Layers**: Unlike previous models that share normalization parameters across blocks, WideNet employs individual normalization layers for each transformer block. This decision allows for more diverse semantic representations, as each block can learn to normalize its inputs differently, thus enhancing the overall modeling capacity.

### Performance Metrics

1. **Empirical Results**: The researchers demonstrate that WideNet outperforms existing models such as Vision Transformer (ViT) and ALBERT on various benchmarks while using fewer parameters. For instance, WideNet achieves a 1.5% improvement over ViT on ImageNet-1K with only 0.72Ã— the number of trainable parameters.

### Balanced Loading

1. **Load Balancing**: To ensure that the experts are utilized effectively, the researchers introduce a buffer capacity \( B \) to limit the number of tokens assigned to each expert. This prevents any single expert from becoming overloaded with tokens, which could lead to suboptimal training. The load balancing loss is defined as:
   \[
   l_{balance} = E \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{E} m_i \cdot P_i
   \]
   where \( m_i \) is the fraction of tokens dispatched to expert \( i \). This loss encourages a more uniform distribution of tokens across experts, improving the overall efficiency of the model.

### Conclusion

WideNet represents a significant advancement in the design of transformer models by prioritizing parameter efficiency through a wider architecture rather than a deeper one. By leveraging parameter sharing, MoE layers, and individual normalization, the framework achieves superior performance on both computer vision and natural language processing tasks with fewer trainable parameters. This approach not only enhances the model's capacity to learn complex representations but also makes it more adaptable to various tasks without the need for extensive computational resources.
