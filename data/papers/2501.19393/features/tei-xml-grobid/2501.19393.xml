<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Test-time scaling is a promising new approach to language modeling that uses extra test-time compute to improve performance. Recently, OpenAI's o1 model showed this capability but did not publicly share its methodology, leading to many replication efforts. We seek the simplest approach to achieve test-time scaling and strong reasoning performance. First, we curate a small dataset s1K of 1,000 questions paired with reasoning traces relying on three criteria we validate through ablations: difficulty, diversity, and quality. Second, we develop budget forcing to control test-time compute by forcefully terminating the model's thinking process or lengthening it by appending "Wait" multiple times to the model's generation when it tries to end. This can lead the model to doublecheck its answer, often fixing incorrect reasoning steps. After supervised finetuning the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct language model on s1K and equipping it with budget forcing, our model s1-32B exceeds o1-preview on competition math questions by up to 27% (MATH and AIME24). Further, scaling s1-32B with budget forcing allows extrapolating beyond its performance without test-time intervention: from 50% to 57% on AIME24. Our model, data, and code are open-source at <ref type="url" target="https://github.com/simplescaling/s1">https: //github.com/simplescaling/s1</ref>. * Equal contribution. ZY and NM started the project. WS, NM and ZY collected the prompts, XL, ZY and NM, built the data pipeline, LZ and WS proposed using a 1K subset and ZY and NM built budget forcing.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Performance improvements of language models (LMs) over the past years have largely relied on scaling up train-time compute using large-scale self-supervised pretraining <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kaplan et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hoffmann et al., 2022)</ref>. The creation of these powerful models has set the stage for a new scaling paradigm built on top of them: test-time scaling. The aim of this approach is to increase the compute at test time to get better results. There has been much work exploring this idea <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Snell et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Welleck et al., 2024)</ref>, and the viability of this paradigm was recently validated by OpenAI o1 <ref type="bibr">(OpenAI, 2024)</ref>. o1 has demonstrated strong reasoning performance with consistent gains from scaling test-time compute. OpenAI describes their approach as using largescale reinforcement learning (RL) implying the use of sizable amounts of data <ref type="bibr">(OpenAI, 2024)</ref>. This has led to various attempts to replicate their models relying on techniques like Monte Carlo Tree Search <ref type="bibr">(Gao et al., 2024b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2024a)</ref>, multi-agent approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Qin et al., 2024)</ref>, and others <ref type="bibr">(Wang et al., 2024a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Huang et al., 2024b;</ref><ref type="bibr">2025)</ref>. Among these approaches, DeepSeek R1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025)</ref> has successfully replicated o1-level performance, also employing reinforcement learning via millions of samples and multiple training stages. However, despite the large number of o1 replication attempts, none have openly replicated a clear test-time scaling behavior. Thus, we ask: what is the simplest approach to achieve both test-time scaling and strong reasoning performance?</p><p>We show that training on only 1,000 samples with next-token prediction and controlling thinking duration via a simple test-time technique we refer to as budget forcing leads to a strong reasoning model that scales in performance with more test-time compute. Specifically, we construct s1K, which consists of 1,000 carefully curated questions paired with reasoning traces and answers distilled from Gemini Thinking Experimental <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Google, 2024)</ref>. We perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of an off-the-shelf pretrained model 1 arXiv: <ref type="bibr">2501.19393v2 [cs.CL]</ref> 3 Feb 2025 s1: Simple test-time scaling on our small dataset requiring just 26 minutes of training on 16 H100 GPUs. After training, we control the amount of test-time compute our model spends using budget forcing: (I) If the model generates more thinking tokens than a desired limit, we forcefully end the thinking process by appending an end-of-thinking token delimiter. Ending the thinking this way makes the model transition to generating its answer. (II) If we want the model to spend more test-time compute on a problem, we suppress the generation of the end-of-thinking token delimiter and instead append "Wait" to the model's current reasoning trace to encourage more exploration. Equipped with this simple recipe -SFT on 1,000 samples and test-time budget forcing -our model s1-32B exhibits test-time scaling (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Further, s1-32B is the most sample-efficient reasoning model and outperforms closed-source models like OpenAI's o1-preview (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). We conduct extensive ablation experiments targeting (a) our selection of 1,000 (1K) reasoning samples and (b) our testtime scaling. For (a), we find that jointly incorporating difficulty, diversity, and quality measures into our selection algorithm is important. Random selection, selecting samples with the longest reasoning traces, or only selecting maximally diverse samples all lead to significantly worse performance (around -30% on AIME24 on average). Training on our full data pool of 59K examples, a superset of s1K, does not offer substantial gains over our 1K selection. This highlights the importance of careful data selection and echoes prior findings for instruction tuning <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Zhou et al., 2023)</ref>. For (b), we define desiderata for test-time scaling methods to compare different approaches. Budget forcing leads to the best scaling as it has perfect controllability with a clear positive slope leading to strong performance.</p><p>In summary, our contributions are: We develop simple methods for creating a sample-efficient reasoning dataset ( §2) and test-time scaling ( §3); Based on these we build s1-32B which is competitive with o1-preview ( §4); We ablate subtleties of data ( §5.1) and test-time scaling ( §5.2). We end with a discussion to motivate future work on simple reasoning ( §6).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Reasoning data curation to create s1K</head><p>In this section, we describe our process for creating a large dataset first in §2.1 and then filtering it down to s1K in §2.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Initial collection of 59K samples</head><p>We collect an initial 59,029 questions from 16 diverse sources following three guiding principles. Quality: Datasets should be of high quality; we always inspect samples and ignore datasets with, e.g., poor formatting; Difficulty: Datasets should be challenging and require significant reasoning effort; Diversity: Datasets should stem from different fields to cover different reasoning tasks. We collect datasets of two categories: Curation of existing datasets Our largest source is <ref type="bibr">Nu-minaMATH (LI et al., 2024)</ref> with 30,660 mathematical problems from online websites. We also include historical AIME problems . To enhance diversity, we add OlympicArena <ref type="bibr">(Huang et al., 2024a)</ref> with 4,250 questions spanning Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Geography, Mathematics, and Physics from various Olympiads. OmniMath <ref type="bibr">(Gao et al., 2024a)</ref> adds 4,238 competition-level mathematics problems. We also include 2,385 problems from AGIEval <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Zhong et al., 2023)</ref>, which features questions from standardized tests like SAT and LSAT, covering English, Law, and Logic. We refer to Table <ref type="table">6</ref> in §B for our other sources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>New datasets in quantitative reasoning</head><p>To complement these existing datasets, we create two original datasets. s1-prob consists of 182 questions from the probability section of Stanford University's Statistics Department's PhD Qualifying Exams (<ref type="url" target="https://statistics.stanford.edu">https://statistics. stanford.edu</ref>), accompanied by handwritten solutions that cover difficult proofs. The probability qualifying exam is held yearly and requires professional-level mathematical problem-solving. s1-teasers comprises 23 challenging brain-teasers commonly used in interview questions for quantitative trading positions. Each sample consists of a problem and solution taken from PuzzledQuant (<ref type="url" target="https://www.puzzledquant.com/">https: //www.puzzledquant.com/</ref>). We only take examples with the highest difficulty level ("Hard").</p><p>For each question, we generate a reasoning trace and solution using the Google Gemini Flash Thinking API <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Google, 2024)</ref> extracting its reasoning trace and response. This yields 59K triplets of a question, generated reasoning trace, and generated solution. Examples from our dataset are in §C.2. We decontaminate all samples against our evaluation questions (MATH500, GPQA Diamond, AIME24; §B.5) using 8-grams and deduplicate the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Final selection of 1K samples</head><p>We could directly train on our pool of 59K questions, however, our goal is to find the simplest approach with minimal resources. Thus, we go through three stages of filtering to arrive at a minimal set of 1,000 samples relying on our three guiding data principles: Quality, Difficulty, and Diversity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quality</head><p>We first remove any questions where we ran into any API errors reducing our dataset to 54,116 samples. Next, we filter out low-quality examples by checking if they contain any string patterns with formatting issues, such as ASCII art diagrams, non-existent image references, or inconsistent on topics in mathematics but also includes other sciences such as biology, physics, and economics. To select our final examples from the pool of 24,496 questions, we first choose one domain uniformly at random. Then, we sample one problem from this domain according to a distribution that favors longer reasoning traces (see §B.4 for details) as motivated in Difficulty. We repeat this process until we have 1,000 total samples. This three-stage process yields a dataset spanning 50 different domains (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">5</ref>). In §5.1, we will show that using our three criteria in combination is important, as only relying on quality, diversity, or difficulty in isolation leads to worse datasets. Examples from our dataset are in §C.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Test-time scaling</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Method</head><p>We classify test-time scaling methods into 1) Sequential, where later computations depend on earlier ones (e.g., a long reasoning trace), and 2) Parallel, where computations run independently (e.g., majority voting) <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Snell et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Brown et al., 2024)</ref>. We focus on sequential scaling as intuitively we believe it should scale better, since later computations can build on intermediate results, allowing for deeper reasoning and iterative refinement. We propose new sequential scaling methods and ways to benchmark them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Budget forcing</head><p>We propose a simple decoding-time intervention by forcing a maximum and/or minimum number of thinking tokens at test time. Specifically, we enforce a maximum token count by simply appending the end-of-thinking token delimiter and "Final Answer:" to early exit the Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Budget forcing with s1-32B. The model tries to stop after "...is 2.", but we suppress the end-of-thinking token delimiter instead appending "Wait" leading s1-32B to self-correct its answer.</p><p>thinking stage and make the model provide its current best answer. To enforce a minimum, we suppress the generation of the end-of-thinking token delimiter and optionally append the string "Wait" to the model's current reasoning trace to encourage the model to reflect on its current generation. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> contains an example of how this simple approach can lead the model to arrive at a better answer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Baselines</head><p>We benchmark budget forcing with: (I) Conditional length-control methods, which rely on telling the model in the prompt how long it should generate for. We group them by granularity into (a) Token-conditional control: We specify an upper bound of thinking tokens in the prompt; <ref type="bibr">(b)</ref> Step-conditional control: We specify an upper bound of thinking steps, where each step is around 100 tokens; (c) Class-conditional control: We write two generic prompts that tell the model to either think for a short or long amount of time (see §D.1 for details). (II) Rejection sampling, which samples until a generation fits a predetermined compute budget. This oracle captures the posterior over responses conditioned on its length.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Metrics</head><p>We establish a set of desiderata as evaluation metrics to measure test-time scaling across methods. Importantly, we do not only care about the accuracy a method can achieve but also its controllability and test-time scaling slope. For each method we consider, we run a set of evaluations 𝑎 ∈  varying test-time compute on a fixed benchmark, e.g. AIME24. This produces a piece-wise linear function 𝑓 with compute as the x-axis measured in thinking tokens and accuracy as the y-axis (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, where the rightmost dot for AIME24 corresponds to 𝑓 (7320) = 57%). We measure three metrics:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Control = 1 || ∑ 𝑎∈ 𝕀(𝑎 min ≤ 𝑎 ≤ 𝑎 max ) (1)</formula><p>where 𝑎 min , 𝑎 max refer to a pre-specified minimum and maximum amount of test-time compute; in our case thinking tokens. We usually only constrain 𝑎 max . As tokens generated correspond to the amount of test-time compute spent, this metric measures the extent to which a method allows controllability over the use of that test-time compute. We report it as a percentage with 100% being perfect control.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Scaling = 1 ( || 2 ) ∑ 𝑎,𝑏∈ 𝑏&gt;𝑎 𝑓 (𝑏) -𝑓 (𝑎) 𝑏 -𝑎 (2)</formula><p>Scaling is the average slope of the piece-wise linear function.</p><p>It must be positive for useful methods and larger is better.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Performance = max 𝑎∈ 𝑓 (𝑎)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Performance is simply the maximum performance the method achieves on the benchmark. A method with monotonically increasing scaling achieves 100% performance on any benchmark in the limit. However, the methods we investigate eventually flatten out or further scaling fails due to control or context window limitations.</p></div>

Finetuning took 26 minutes on 16 NVIDIA H100 GPUs with PyTorch FSDP.</p><p>Evaluation We select three representative reasoning benchmarks widely used in the field: AIME24 (of America, 2024) consists of 30 problems that were used in the 2024 American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) held from Wednesday, January 31 -Thursday, February 1, 2024. AIME tests mathematical problem-solving with arithmetic, algebra, counting, geometry, number theory, probability, and other secondary school math topics. High-scoring high school students in the test are invited to participate in the United States of America Mathematics Olympiad (USAMO).</p><p>All AIME answers are integers ranging from 000 to 999, inclusive. Some AIME problems rely on figures that we provide to our model using the vector graphics language Asymptote as it cannot take image inputs. MATH500 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hendrycks et al., 2021)</ref> is a benchmark of competition math problems of varying difficulty. We evaluate on the same 500 samples selected by OpenAI in prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lightman et al., 2023)</ref>. GPQA Diamond <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Rein et al., 2023)</ref> consists of 198 s1: Simple test-time scaling Forcing 2048/4096 max thinking tokens Ignoring end-of-thinking 2x/4x/6x and appending "Wait" thus forcing it to continue reasoning when it tries to stop  PhD-level science questions from Biology, Chemistry and Physics. Experts with PhDs in the corresponding domains only achieved 69.7% on GPQA Diamond (OpenAI, 2024). When we write "GPQA" in the context of evaluation in this work, we always refer to the Diamond subset.

As it has no official evaluation scores, we use the Gemini API to benchmark it ourselves. However, the "recitation error" of the Gemini API makes evaluation challenging. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> We circumvent this, by manually inserting all 30 AIME24 questions in its web interface where the error does not appear.

Suppressing the end-of-thinking token delimiter too often can lead the model into repetitive loops instead of continued reasoning.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> (right), we show that after training Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct on our 1,000 samples to produce s1-32B and equipping it with the simple budget forcing technique, it operates in a different scaling paradigm. Scaling test-time compute on the base model via majority voting cannot catch up with the performance of s1-32B which validates our intuition from §3 that sequential scaling is more effective than parallel. We provide example generations of s1-32B in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample-efficiency</head><p>In Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> (right) and Table <ref type="table">1</ref> we compare s1-32B with other models. We find that s1-32B is the most sample-efficient open data reasoning model. It performs significantly better than our base model (Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct) despite just training it on an additional 1,000 samples. The concurrently released r1-32B shows stronger performance than s1-32B while also only using SFT <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025)</ref>. However, it is trained on 800 × more reasoning samples. It is an open question whether one can achieve their performance with just 1,000 samples. Finally, our model nearly matches Gemini 2.0 Thinking on AIME24. As s1-32B is distilled from Gemini 2.0, this shows our distillation procedure was likely effective.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Data Quantity, Diversity, and Difficulty</head><p>In §2 we outlined our three guiding principles in curating s1K: Quality, Difficulty, and Diversity. Here we test the importance of combining them and the overall efficacy of our selection. Only Quality (1K-random): After obtaining our high-quality reasoning chains from Gemini, we select 1,000 samples at random; not relying on our difficulty and diversity filtering at all. Table <ref type="table">2</ref> shows this approach performs much worse than s1K across all benchmarks. Only Diversity (1K-diverse): For this dataset, we sample uniformly across domains to maximize diversity disregarding any notion of difficulty. This approach also leads to poor performance similar to 1K-random. Only Difficulty (1K-longest): Here we rely on one of our difficulty indicators introduced in §2 by selecting the 1,000 samples with the longest reasoning traces. This approach significantly boosts GPQA performance but overall still falls short of using s1K. Maximize Quantity: Finally, we compare with just training on all of our 59K Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. s1K data ablations. We budget force (BF) a maximum of around 30,000 thinking tokens for all scores in this table. This performs slightly better than the scores without BF (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) as it allows the model to finish with a best guess when stuck in an infinite loop. We report 95% paired bootstrap confidence intervals for differences relative to the s1K model using 10,000 bootstrap samples. E.g., the interval [-13%, 20%] means that, with 95% confidence, the true difference between 59K-full and s1K is between -13% and +20%. If the entire interval is negative, e.g. [-27%, -3%], we can confidently say that the performance is worse than s1K.</p></div>

In the ≤ 4000 setting the model directly jumps to the correct approach, while for the ≤ 8000 setting it backtracks a lot. We hypothesize that there is a correlation such that shorter generations tend to be the ones where the model was on the right track from the start, whereas longer ones tend to be ones where the model made mistakes and thus backtracks or questions itself. This leads to longer samples often being wrong when rejection sampling and thus the inverse scaling trend.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Sample-efficient reasoning</head><p>Models There are a number of concurrent efforts to build models that replicate the performance of o1 (OpenAI, 2024). For example, DeepSeek-r1 and k1.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Team et al., 2025)</ref> are built with reinforcement learning methods, while others rely on SFT using tens of thousands of distilled examples <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Team, 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Xu et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Labs, 2025)</ref>. We show that SFT on only 1,000 examples suffices to build a competitive reasoning model matching o1-preview and produces a model that lies on the pareto frontier (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Further, we introduce budget forcing which combined with our reasoning model leads to the first reproduction of OpenAI's test-time scaling curves <ref type="bibr">(OpenAI, 2024)</ref>. Why does supervised finetuning on just 1,000 samples lead to such performance gains? We hypothesize that the model is already exposed to large amounts of reasoning data during pretraining which spans trillions of tokens. Thus, the ability to perform reasoning is already present in our model. Our sample-efficient finetuning stage just activates it and we scale it further at test time with budget forcing. This is similar to the "Superficial Alignment Hypothesis" presented in LIMA <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Zhou et al., 2023)</ref>, where the authors find that 1,000 examples can be sufficient to align a model to adhere to user preferences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benchmarks and methods</head><p>To evaluate and push the limits of these models, increasingly challenging benchmarks have been introduced, such as Olympiad-level science competitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(He et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Jain et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Zhong et al., 2023)</ref> and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Srivastava et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Glazer et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Su et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kim et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Phan et al., 2025)</ref>. To enhance models' performance on reasoning-related tasks, researchers have pursued several strategies: Prior works have explored continuing training language models on specialized corpora related to mathematics and science <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Azerbayev et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Yang et al., 2024)</ref>, sometimes even synthetically generated data <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Yu et al., 2024)</ref>. Others have developed training methodologies specifically aimed at reasoning performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Zelikman et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Luo et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Yuan et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wu et al., 2024a)</ref>. Another significant line of work focuses on prompting-based methods to elicit and improve reasoning abilities, including methods like Chainof-Thought prompting <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Wei et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yao et al., 2023a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bi et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Fu et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2024b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Xiang et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hu et al., 2024)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Test-time scaling</head><p>Methods As we introduce in §3, we differentiate two methods to scale test-time compute: parallel and sequential. The former relies on multiple solution attempts generated in parallel and selecting the best outcome via specific criteria. These criteria include choosing the most frequent response for majority voting or the best response based on an external reward for Best-of-N <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brown et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Irvine et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Snell et al., 2024)</ref>.

Tree-based search methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gandhi et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wu et al., 2024b)</ref> offer a hybrid approach between sequential and parallel scaling, such as Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Liu et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Zhang et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Zhou et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Choi et al., 2023)</ref> and guided beam search <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Xie et al., 2023)</ref>. REBASE <ref type="bibr">(Wu et al., 2024b)</ref> employs a process reward model to balance exploitation and pruning during tree search. Empirically, REBASE has been shown to outperform sampling-based methods and MCTS <ref type="bibr">(Wu et al., 2024b)</ref>. Reward models <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lightman et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang et al., 2024b</ref>;c) play a key role in these methods. They come in two variants: outcome reward models and process reward models. Outcome reward models <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Xin et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ankner et al., 2024)</ref> assign a score to complete solutions and are particularly useful in Best-of-N selection, while process reward models <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lightman et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang et al., 2024b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wu et al., 2024b)</ref> assess individual reasoning steps and are effective in guiding tree-based search methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limits to further test-time scaling</head><p>We have shown that budget forcing allows extrapolating test-time compute in §4, e.g., improving AIME24 performance from 50% to 57%. However, it has two key limitations when scaling further: it eventually flattens out (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>), and the context window of the underlying language model constrains it. Despite these constraints, our work shows test-time scaling across a wide range of accuracies (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), partly because scaling down test-time compute behaves predictably and does not suffer from these constraints.</p><p>Continuing test-time scaling will require approaches that can further extrapolate test-time compute.

Scaling further with parallel scaling methods. All metrics averaged over the 30 questions in AIME24. Average thinking tokens for REBASE do not account for the additional compute from the reward model. For sequential scaling, we prompt the model to use up to (from left to right) 32, 64, 256, and 512 steps. For REBASE and majority voting we generate 16 parallel trajectories to aggregate across. forcing such as rotating through different strings, not only "Wait", or combining it with frequency penalties or higher temperature to avoid repetitive loops. An exciting direction for future work is also researching whether applying budget forcing to a reasoning model trained with reinforcement learning yields better extrapolation; or if RL allows for new ways of test-time scaling beyond budget forcing. Our work defines the right metrics ( §3.2) -Control, Scaling, and Performance -to enable future research and progress on extrapolating test-time compute. Parallel scaling as a solution Parallel scaling offers one solution to the limits of sequential scaling, thus we augment our sequentially scaled model with two methods: (I) Majority voting: After generating 𝑘 solutions, the final solution is the most frequent one across generations; (II) Tree search via REBASE: We use the REBASE process reward model, which is initialized from LLaMA-34B and further finetuned on a synthetic process reward modeling dataset <ref type="bibr">(Wu et al., 2024b)</ref>. We then aggregate the solutions generated by REBASE via majority voting. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>, augmenting our model with REBASE scales better than majority voting, and even sequential scaling in this scenario. However, REBASE requires an additional forward pass at each step for the reward model adding some computation overhead. For sequential scaling, when prompted to use up to 512 steps, for 12 out of the 30 evaluation questions the model generates a response that exceeds the context window leading to a large performance drop. Overall, we find that these parallel scaling methods complement sequential scaling thus they offer an avenue for scaling test-time compute even further; beyond fixed context windows.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Training details</head><p>We take a model that has already been pretrained and instruction tuned and further finetune it for reasoning. Specifically, we use Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Qwen et al., 2024)</ref>, which on math tasks generally matches or outperforms the larger Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Qwen et al., 2024)</ref> or other open models <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dubey et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Groeneveld et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Muennighoff et al., 2024)</ref>. We use token delimiters to separate the thinking stage from the answering stage. We enclose the thinking stage with &lt;|im_start|&gt;think and &lt;|im_start|&gt;answer; both preceded and followed by a newline. Samples from our dataset are in §C.2. We use basic fine-tuning hyperparameters: we train for 5 epochs with a batch size of 16 for a total of 315 gradient steps. We train in bfloat16 precision with a learning rate of 1𝑒 -5 warmed up linearly for 5% (16 steps) and then decayed to 0 over the rest of training (299 steps) following a cosine schedule. We use the AdamW optimizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Loshchilov &amp; Hutter, 2019)</ref> with 𝛽 1 = 0.9, 𝛽 2 = 0.95 and weight decay of 1𝑒 -4. We do not compute loss on questions, only on reasoning traces and solutions. We ensure the sequence length is large enough to avoid cutting off any samples; a setting we ablate in §C.1. The training takes just 26 minutes on 16 NVIDIA H100 GPUs.  We find that a shorter training sequence length leads to longer reasoning traces at test time. This is because when training with a shorter sequence length the answer section of the training sample is more commonly cut off. Inversely, when the training sequence length is longer, more samples appear in their entirety with the section where the model answers. Thus the model receives more gradient updates where it learns to generate an answer following its chain. This in turn leads to a higher log probability of the answer section at any point during the generation and thus shorter reasoning traces at test time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C.1. Training Ablations: Sequence length</head><p>Performance-wise, we also find that the model trained with a longer sequence length performs better. Thus we opt for the longest training sequence length as it leads to better performance and makes inference more efficient by leading to shorter reasoning traces.</p></div>

It is evident that 𝑌 ∞ ∈ 𝑚 ∞ (since it is almost sure limit of 𝑌 𝑛 ∈ 𝑚 𝑛 ) and hence 𝔼 [ 𝑌 ∞ | ∞ ] = 𝑌 ∞ almost surely. Combining the above observations we conclude that 𝔼 [ 𝑌 𝑛 | 𝑛 ] 𝐿 1 ⟶ 𝑌 ∞ . Similarly, 𝔼 [ 𝑍 𝑛 | 𝑛 ] 𝐿 1 ⟶ 𝑍 ∞ . Now invoke Equation (4), to conclude that 𝑌 ∞ = 𝑍 ∞ almost surely.</formula><p>2.

(b) Let  ∞ = 𝜎(, 𝑍 0 , 𝑍 1 , …) and  ∞ = 𝜎(, 𝑌 0 , 𝑌 1 , …). We have 𝑌 ∞ = 𝔼[𝑋| ∞ ] and 𝑍 ∞ = 𝔼[𝑋| ∞ ]. Consider the 𝜎-algebra  =  ∞ ∨  ∞ = 𝜎(, , 𝑌 0 , 𝑍 0 , 𝑌 1 , 𝑍 1 , …). Consider 𝑊 = 𝔼[𝑋|]. We have  ∞ ⊆ , so 𝔼[𝑊 | ∞ ] = 𝔼[𝔼[𝑋|]| ∞ ] = 𝔼[𝑋| ∞ ] = 𝑌 ∞ . Since 𝑊 is -measurable, 𝔼[𝑊 | ∞ ] = 𝑌 ∞ implies that 𝑌 ∞ is the conditional expectation of 𝑊 given  ∞ . But since 𝑌 ∞ is already  ∞ -measurable, we have 𝔼[𝑊 | ∞ ] = 𝑊 if 𝑊 is  ∞ -measurable, which is not necessarily true. However, we know that 𝔼[𝑌 ∞ | ∞ ] = 𝑌 ∞ and 𝔼[𝑍 ∞ | ∞ ] = 𝑍 ∞ . Consider 𝔼[𝑋| ∞ ∨  ∞ ]. Then 𝔼[𝔼[𝑋| ∞ ∨  ∞ ]| ∞ ] = 𝔼[𝑋| ∞ ] = 𝑌 ∞ . This implies that 𝔼[𝑋| ∞ ∨  ∞ ] = 𝑌 ∞ almost surely. Similarly, 𝔼[𝔼[𝑋| ∞ ∨  ∞ ]| ∞ ] = 𝔼[𝑋| ∞ ] = 𝑍 ∞ .

Final Answer: The final answer is 𝐸 when counting down ("3 steps left...2 steps left") rather than counting up ("Step2...Step3..."). This is likely because if counting down, the final step is always 1, which will act as a strong prior to the model to finish its generation. If counting up, the final step before the answer varies, thus if the model does not remember the original step instruction, it may fail to stop. We conclude the following from our results in Table <ref type="table">12:</ref> (1) The model still struggles to adhere to the step limit. The model sometimes simply continues counting into negative steps, e.g. "-1 steps left". To solve this issue, we automatically stop the thinking process once 0 steps are reached and then force the model to transition to answering mode by appending the answer token delimiter ( §3). This leads to perfect step adherence (lower half of Table <ref type="table">12</ref>), yet problems remain. (2) The model compensates for fewer steps by making each step longer. For example, when forced to use up to 16 steps vs 256 steps, the model generates an average of 96 tokens per step vs 56. Despite this issue, more steps still clearly correlate with more total thinking tokens in Table <ref type="table">12</ref> and better performance leading to a positive slope (3) Step instructions are more costly than other methods. The step delimiters require around 6 tokens each which for e.g. 64 steps adds up to a total of around 380 tokens. When ignoring the step delimiters in token counts as in Table <ref type="table">12</ref>, the model still requires 7551 thinking tokens on average to achieve only 33.3% on AIME24. To compute Control reported in Table <ref type="table">3</ref> for step-conditional control variants, we first decide that 100 tokens are an upper limit per step and then multiply this number by the steps instructed to arrive at a proxy total token limit, e.g. 1600 for 16 steps instructed. We then check whether the thinking tokens in Table <ref type="table">12</ref> fit within the respective limit for each evaluation run (3/5 for without intervention; 5/5 for with intervention). For the model in Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>, we use a model with step-conditional control trained on an earlier version of our data and using an earlier version of our evaluation codebase.</p><p>Class-conditional control OpenAI exposes test-time compute control to users via a "reasoning_effort" API parameter with three possible settings: low, medium, and high. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">3</ref> The OpenAI documentation also states that "Reducing reasoning effort can result in faster responses and fewer tokens used on reasoning in a response." suggesting that they are unable to control test-time compute with guarantees. Thus, maybe OpenAI simply adjusts the prompt or system instruction depending on the reasoning effort desired. In Table <ref type="table">13</ref>, we show that separate prompts for short and long thinking allow us to control thinking time to some extent: Prompting the model to think for longer leads to longer thinking. However, it does not reliably improve performance and control is not precise. The current adherence to control may suffice when we only have three classes, but it might not scale to finer-grained classes. To compute Control reported in Table <ref type="table">3</ref> for this method, we assume that prompting the model to think for a short time in Table <ref type="table">13</ref> should produce fewer tokens than the default for AIME24, while the long prompt should produce more. As 8033 &gt; 6109 and 9651 &gt; 6109, one out of two follows our expected control thus Control is 50%.</p></div>

Possible sources of minor discrepancies: rounding errors, precision of constants. Let's verify the formula derivation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3𝜎</head><p>The formula derivation seems correct. Let's use approximate values to check the order of magnitude. 𝜌 𝑝𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟,ℎ𝑢𝑚𝑎𝑛 ≈ 10 3 W∕m 3 𝑅 𝑠𝑢𝑛 ≈ 7 × 10 8 m 𝜎 ≈ 6 × 10 -8 Wm -2 K -4 𝑇 4 ≈ 10 3 ×7×10 8 3×6×10 -8 = 7×10 11 18×10 -8 = 0.38 × 10 19 = 3.8 × 10 18 𝑇 ≈ (3.8 × 10 18 ) 1∕4 = (3800 × 10 15 ) 1∕4 𝑇 ≈ (3800) 0.25 × 10 3.75 (3800) 0.25 : 7 4 = 2401, 8 4 = 4096. So, between 7 and 8. ≈ 7.8 𝑇 ≈ 7.8 × 10 3.75 = 7800 × 5.6 = 43680 K The order of magnitude seems consistent with the detailed calculation. The problem statement is straightforward and doesn't seem to have any hidden complexities. The assumptions made are standard for such problems. Consider the precision of the given values. Power of human: 100 W (exact) Volume of human: 66400 cm 3 (exact) The result obtained is very close to option E. Given the nature of multiple-choice questions, the closest option is likely the intended answer. If there were any misinterpretations of the question, it would likely be in the setup. However, the phrase "If the sun were the same size, but it produced the same amount of power per unit volume as a human" seems clear. The surface temperature is calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, assuming black-body radiation. Double-check the provided options: A: 3500 K B: 10000 K C: 25000 K D: 40000 K E: 50000 K Our calculated value is approximately 49800 K, which is closest to 50000 K. If we used more precise values for the constants, the result might be slightly different, but likely not enough to shift to another option. The fun fact mentioned in the question implies that the power density of a human is higher than that of the sun. Let's verify this. Power output of the sun: 3.846 × 10 26 W Volume of the sun: 4.43 × 10 27 m 3 Power density of the sun: 3.846×10 26 4.43×10 27 = 0.868 W∕m 3 Power density of human: 1506 W∕m 3 Indeed, the power density of a human is significantly higher than that of the sun. Final check of the calculation steps and logic. The approach of equating the power density of the modified sun to that of a human and then using the Stefan-Boltzmann law seems correct.   Token-conditional control One general approach is to simply tell a model in the prompt precisely how many tokens it should generate. Ideally, the model can keep track of its token count and adjust its generation to finish within the desired limits. We experiment with this approach by training a model with token instructions using the format in Figure <ref type="figure">10</ref> (left).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Test-time scaling details</head><p>We bucket the lengths of the reasoning traces from our 1,000 training examples into powers of two (rounded upwards) and add a corresponding instruction to the user prompt. For example, if the instruction says "Think for up to 2048 tokens", then the reasoning trace has anywhere between 1024 and 2048 tokens. In Table <ref type="table">11</ref>, we show that after training the model hardly follows the token instruction. It does sometimes generate more tokens when given a higher limit but often overshoots the limit. This may not be unique to our model as prior work suggests that OpenAI o1-mini can also not follow token instructions <ref type="bibr">(Zhang &amp; Chen, 2024</ref>). To prevent exceeding the limit, we test budget forcing the thinking to end once the limit is reached. This leads to perfect control <ref type="bibr">(Table 11 (lower)</ref>). With budget forcing, the scaling trend is also clearer as the model can no longer overshoot the limit when given a small thinking budget. This leads to better test-time scaling values for Token Prompting + budget forcing in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. To compute Control reported in Table <ref type="table">3</ref> for token-conditional control variants we divide the number of times the thinking tokens in Table 11 are less than the upper limit by the total evaluations (2/5 for without intervention; 5/5 for with intervention).</p><p>Step-conditional control Token instructions fail as current models cannot count tokens. To accommodate this lack of capability, we experiment with making the counting more coarse-grained. We partition the reasoning traces into steps and ask the model to think for a specific number of steps rather than tokens. We split our reasoning traces on double newlines into steps, which we find act as intuitive separators based on manual inspection of samples. We bucket our training samples into powers of 2 depending on their number of steps and add a corresponding step instruction following the format in Figure <ref type="figure">10</ref> (right).

The point 𝐶 lies on both the line 𝐴𝐵 and the astroid. Differentiating the astroid equation implicitly: So 𝑦 = 3 √ 3𝑥. Substitute into the line equation:</p><p>). We need to check if this point lies on the segment 𝐴𝐵.</p><p>8 . So 𝐶 lies on 𝐴𝐵. We need to make sure 0 &lt; 𝑡 &lt; 1, which is true for 𝑡 = 3 4 . Now, we need to check if this point 𝐶 does not belong to any other segment from  . The point 𝐶 lies on the astroid. The segment 𝐴𝐵 is tangent to the astroid at 𝐶. Any other segment from  that contains 𝐶 would have 𝐶 as an interior point, not a tangent point. Consider the parametrization of the family  . A point (𝑥, 𝑦) belongs to some segment in  iff there exists 𝜃 such that 𝑥 cos 𝜃 + 𝑦 sin 𝜃 = 1. For the point 𝐶 = ( 1 8 , 3 √ 3 8 ), we have:</p><p>We know that 𝐶 lies on 𝐴𝐵, which corresponds to some specific segment in  . The problem statement assumes the existence and uniqueness of such a point 𝐶. The unique point 𝐶 on 𝐴𝐵, distinct from 𝐴 and 𝐵, that does not belong to any segment from  other than 𝐴𝐵. This means that if 𝐶 lies on another segment 𝑃 ′ 𝑄 ′ ∈  , then 𝑃 ′ 𝑄 ′ = 𝐴𝐵. The point 𝐶 is the point of tangency of 𝐴𝐵 with the astroid. Now we need to find 𝑂𝐶 2 .</p><p>8 ) 2 = 1 64 + 27 64 = 28 64 = 7 16 . Here 𝑝 = 7 and 𝑞 = 16. 𝑝 and 𝑞 are relatively prime. 𝑝 + 𝑞 = 7 + 16 = 23. Final check of the reasoning: The family  consists of unit-length segments with endpoints on the axes. The envelope of this family is the astroid 𝑥 2∕3 + 𝑦 2∕3 = 1. The segments from  are tangent to the astroid. The segment 𝐴𝐵 is also a member of the family  . We are looking for a point 𝐶 on 𝐴𝐵 that lies on the astroid. This point 𝐶 is the point of tangency of 𝐴𝐵 with the astroid.</p><p>If a point on 𝐴𝐵 lies on the astroid, it belongs to the tangent segment at that point. Since 𝐴𝐵 is the tangent segment, this point does not belong to any other segment from  . Consider the case when the segment 𝐴𝐵 intersects the astroid at two points. If the segment 𝐴𝐵 is not tangent to the astroid, then there are two points of intersection. Let the points of intersection be 𝐶 1 and 𝐶 2 . If 𝐶 1 lies on 𝐴𝐵, then the tangent to the astroid at 𝐶 1 is the segment 𝐴𝐵.</p><p>If 𝐶 2 lies on 𝐴𝐵, then the tangent to the astroid at 𝐶 2 is the segment 𝐴𝐵. The slope of 𝐴𝐵 is -√ 3. We found the point on the astroid with tangent slope -√ 3. The problem statement guarantees the uniqueness of such a point 𝐶. The point 𝐶 must be interior to 𝐴𝐵, so 0 &lt; 𝑡 &lt; 1. The parameter 𝑡 = 3 4 is in this range. The point 𝐶 is distinct from 𝐴 and 𝐵.</p><p>2 ). The point of tangency 𝐶 is the unique point on 𝐴𝐵 (excluding endpoints) that lies on the astroid. Solution: Let the family of segments  be defined by segments 𝑃 𝑄 of unit length with 𝑃 on the positive 𝑥-axis and 𝑄 on the positive 𝑦-axis. Let 𝑃 = (𝑎, 0) and 𝑄 = (0, 𝑏). The length condition gives 𝑎 2 + 𝑏 2 = 1. The segment 𝑃 𝑄 lies on the line 𝑥 𝑎 + 𝑦 𝑏 = 1. Using the parametrization 𝑎 = cos 𝜃, 𝑏 = sin 𝜃 with 0 &lt; 𝜃 &lt; 𝜋 2 , the equation of the line is 𝑥 cos 𝜃 + 𝑦 sin 𝜃 = 1. The envelope of this family of lines is the astroid 𝑥 2∕3 + 𝑦 2∕3 = 1. The segments from  are tangent to this astroid.</p><p>The segment 𝐴𝐵 connects 𝐴( 1 2 , 0) and 𝐵(0, √</p><p>2 ). The equation of the line containing 𝐴𝐵 is 𝑦 = -</p><p>2 . This segment is part of the family  . We are looking for a unique point 𝐶 on 𝐴𝐵, distinct from 𝐴 and 𝐵, that does not belong to any segment from  other than 𝐴𝐵. This means 𝐶 is the point where 𝐴𝐵 is tangent to the astroid. The slope of the tangent to the astroid at a point (𝑥, 𝑦) is -3</p><p>Setting the slopes equal:</p><p>The point 𝐶 lies on the line 𝑦 = -√ 3𝑥 + √ 3 2 and satisfies 𝑦 = 3</p><p>The point 𝐶 is the unique point on 𝐴𝐵 (excluding endpoints) that lies on the astroid. The tangent to the astroid at 𝐶 is the segment 𝐴𝐵. Thus, 𝐶 does not belong to any other segment from  .</p></div>
