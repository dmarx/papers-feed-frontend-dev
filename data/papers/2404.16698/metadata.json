  "abstract": "As AI systems pervade human life, ensuring that large language models (LLMs)\nmake safe decisions remains a significant challenge. We introduce the\nGovernance of the Commons Simulation (GovSim), a generative simulation platform\ndesigned to study strategic interactions and cooperative decision-making in\nLLMs. In GovSim, a society of AI agents must collectively balance exploiting a\ncommon resource with sustaining it for future use. This environment enables the\nstudy of how ethical considerations, strategic planning, and negotiation skills\nimpact cooperative outcomes. We develop an LLM-based agent architecture and\ntest it with the leading open and closed LLMs. We find that all but the most\npowerful LLM agents fail to achieve a sustainable equilibrium in GovSim, with\nthe highest survival rate below 54%. Ablations reveal that successful\nmulti-agent communication between agents is critical for achieving cooperation\nin these cases. Furthermore, our analyses show that the failure to achieve\nsustainable cooperation in most LLMs stems from their inability to formulate\nand analyze hypotheses about the long-term effects of their actions on the\nequilibrium of the group. Finally, we show that agents that leverage\n\"Universalization\"-based reasoning, a theory of moral thinking, are able to\nachieve significantly better sustainability. Taken together, GovSim enables us\nto study the mechanisms that underlie sustainable self-government with\nspecificity and scale. We open source the full suite of our research results,\nincluding the simulation environment, agent prompts, and a comprehensive web\ninterface.",
