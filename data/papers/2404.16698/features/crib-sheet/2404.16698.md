- **GOVSIM Overview**: A generative simulation platform for studying strategic interactions and cooperative decision-making among LLM agents in resource-sharing scenarios.
  
- **Key Scenarios**: 
  - **Fishery**: Agents share a lake with a maximum capacity of 100 tons of fish, which doubles monthly. Sustainable catch is up to 10 tons per agent if five agents participate.
  - **Pasture**: Agents manage a pasture that supports 100 hectares of grass, with each sheep consuming 1 hectare per month.
  - **Pollution**: Factory owners balance production with pollution, where each pallet produced pollutes 1% of a shared river.

- **Sustainability Threshold**: Defined as \( f(t) = \max \{x | g(h(t) - x) \geq h(t)\} \), where \( g \) is the resource growth multiplier and \( h(t) \) is the amount of shared resources at time \( t \).

- **Resource Dynamics**: 
  - **Harvesting Phase**: Agents submit resource consumption requests privately, executed simultaneously.
  - **Discussion Phase**: Agents communicate using natural language to negotiate and strategize.

- **Critical Findings**:
  - Most LLM agents fail to achieve sustainable equilibrium, with survival rates below 54%.
  - Successful cooperation is linked to effective multi-agent communication and the ability to simulate long-term effects of actions.

- **Universalization-Based Reasoning**: Agents employing this moral reasoning framework show significantly improved sustainability outcomes.

- **Communication Metrics**: 
  - Negotiation constitutes 62% of agent dialogues.
  - Communication reduces resource overuse by 21%.

- **Survival Metrics**:
  - **Survival Time**: \( m = \max \{t \in \mathbb{N} | h(t) > C\} \), where \( C = 5 \) is the collapse threshold.
  - **Survival Rate**: \( q = \frac{\#(m=12)}{\text{#runs}} \).
  - **Total Gain**: \( R_i = \sum_{t=1}^{T} r_{it} \) for agent \( i \).
  - **Efficiency**: Measures optimal utilization of shared resources relative to maximum possible efficiency.

- **Open Source Contribution**: Full suite of research results, including simulation environment and agent prompts, available at [GitHub](https://github.com/giorgiopiatti/GovSim).

- **Research Implications**: GOVSIM provides insights into the mechanisms of sustainable self-governance and the cooperative capabilities of LLMs, informing future AI safety and cooperation studies.
