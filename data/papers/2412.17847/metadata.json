  "abstract": "Progress in AI is driven largely by the scale and quality of training data.\nDespite this, there is a deficit of empirical analysis examining the attributes\nof well-established datasets beyond text. In this work we conduct the largest\nand first-of-its-kind longitudinal audit across modalities--popular text,\nspeech, and video datasets--from their detailed sourcing trends and use\nrestrictions to their geographical and linguistic representation. Our manual\nanalysis covers nearly 4000 public datasets between 1990-2024, spanning 608\nlanguages, 798 sources, 659 organizations, and 67 countries. We find that\nmultimodal machine learning applications have overwhelmingly turned to\nweb-crawled, synthetic, and social media platforms, such as YouTube, for their\ntraining sets, eclipsing all other sources since 2019. Secondly, tracing the\nchain of dataset derivations we find that while less than 33% of datasets are\nrestrictively licensed, over 80% of the source content in widely-used text,\nspeech, and video datasets, carry non-commercial restrictions. Finally, counter\nto the rising number of languages and geographies represented in public AI\ntraining datasets, our audit demonstrates measures of relative geographical and\nmultilingual representation have failed to significantly improve their coverage\nsince 2013. We believe the breadth of our audit enables us to empirically\nexamine trends in data sourcing, restrictions, and Western-centricity at an\necosystem-level, and that visibility into these questions are essential to\nprogress in responsible AI. As a contribution to ongoing improvements in\ndataset transparency and responsible use, we release our entire multimodal\naudit, allowing practitioners to trace data provenance across text, speech, and\nvideo.",
