- **Objective of the Study**: Conduct a longitudinal audit of nearly 4000 public datasets across text, speech, and video modalities to analyze sourcing trends, use restrictions, and representation.

- **Key Findings**:
  - **Data Sourcing**: Since 2019, multimodal machine learning has increasingly relied on web-crawled, synthetic, and social media sources, particularly YouTube.
  - **Licensing and Restrictions**: Less than 33% of datasets are restrictively licensed; over 80% of source content in widely used datasets has non-commercial restrictions.
  - **Geographical and Linguistic Representation**: Despite an increase in the number of languages and geographies represented, relative measures of representation have not improved since 2013.

- **Methodology**:
  - **Data Annotation**: Utilized a license annotation taxonomy to categorize datasets based on terms of use (Unrestricted, Unspecified, Source Closed, Model Closed).
  - **Expert Involvement**: Engaged AI researchers for annotation tasks to ensure accuracy and rigor in data provenance tracing.

- **Dataset Scope**:
  - **Text**: Focused on post-training datasets for language models, covering 3713 datasets from 108 collections, spanning 1994-2024.
  - **Speech**: Analyzed 95 ASR datasets, emphasizing their role in speech technologies, covering 18 popular tasks from 1990-2024.
  - **Video**: Reviewed 104 datasets for video classification and generation tasks, spanning 2009-2024.

- **Trends in Data Sources**:
  - **Web and Social Media Dominance**: Internet videos, especially from YouTube, have become the primary source for speech and video datasets.
  - **Synthetic Data Growth**: Synthetic data is rapidly increasing, with significant contributions from models like OpenAI's.

- **Implications for Responsible AI**: The findings highlight the need for improved dataset transparency and responsible use to mitigate biases and enhance representation in AI training data.

- **Future Directions**: The audit's release aims to facilitate better practices in dataset sourcing and usage, promoting accountability in AI development.
