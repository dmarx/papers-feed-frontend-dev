The decisions made by the researchers in the ProphetNet paper reflect a thoughtful approach to addressing the limitations of existing sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models, particularly in the context of language modeling and text generation tasks. Below is a detailed technical explanation and rationale for each of the key decisions outlined in your request:

### 1. Decision to Introduce the Future N-gram Prediction Objective
The future n-gram prediction objective was introduced to overcome the limitations of traditional autoregressive (AR) models that focus on one-step-ahead predictions. By predicting multiple future tokens simultaneously, ProphetNet encourages the model to capture long-term dependencies and global coherence in text generation. This approach helps mitigate overfitting to local correlations, which can lead to more coherent and contextually relevant outputs.

### 2. Choice of N-Stream Self-Attention Mechanism
The n-stream self-attention mechanism allows the model to maintain a main stream for standard token prediction while introducing additional streams for future token predictions. This design enables the model to efficiently learn to predict multiple future tokens at each time step without significantly increasing computational complexity. The shared parameters between streams also facilitate easier inference, as the model can revert to a traditional Seq2Seq architecture by disabling the predicting streams.

### 3. Selection of Base Scale (16GB) and Large Scale (160GB) Datasets for Pre-training
The choice of dataset sizes was informed by the need to balance computational efficiency and model performance. The base scale dataset (16GB) is comparable to datasets used in models like BERT, allowing for effective pre-training without excessive resource demands. The large scale dataset (160GB) provides a more extensive training corpus, enabling the model to learn richer representations and achieve state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks.

### 4. Adoption of the Mask-Based Auto-Encoder Denoising Task for Seq2Seq Pre-training
The mask-based auto-encoder denoising task was adopted because it has been shown to be effective in pre-training Seq2Seq models. This task allows the model to learn to reconstruct masked spans of text, which is beneficial for understanding context and improving generation quality. By learning to predict multiple future tokens within masked spans, ProphetNet enhances its ability to generate coherent and contextually appropriate text.

### 5. Design Decision to Share Parameters Between Main Stream and Predicting Streams
Sharing parameters between the main stream and predicting streams reduces the overall model size and complexity while ensuring that the model can leverage learned representations across different tasks. This design choice simplifies the architecture and allows for efficient training and inference, as the model can easily switch between predicting future tokens and generating text in a traditional manner.

### 6. Implementation of the Two-Stream Self-Attention Mechanism
The two-stream self-attention mechanism was implemented to facilitate the simultaneous prediction of future tokens while maintaining the structure of the original Transformer architecture. This approach allows the model to attend to both past tokens and the hidden states of the main stream, ensuring that future predictions are informed by the context provided by previous tokens.

### 7. Strategy for Balancing Weights Between Traditional Language Modeling and Future N-gram Prediction
The researchers employed a power attenuation function to balance the weights between traditional language modeling and future n-gram prediction. This strategy allows the model to prioritize immediate token predictions while still encouraging it to consider future tokens, thus promoting a balance between local coherence and global context in generated text.

### 8. Decision to Disable N-Stream Self-Attention During Inference
Disabling n-stream self-attention during inference simplifies the model's operation, allowing it to function as a traditional Seq2Seq model. This design choice ensures that the model can generate text in a straightforward manner, predicting one token at a time, which is essential for practical applications in text generation.

### 9. Choice of Benchmarks for Evaluation (CNN/DailyMail, Gigaword, SQuAD 1.1)
The selected benchmarks are widely recognized in the natural language processing community for evaluating summarization and question generation tasks. By using these established datasets, the researchers can effectively demonstrate the performance improvements of ProphetNet over existing models, providing a clear comparison of its capabilities.

### 10. Decision to Use Token Span Masking for the Denoising Task
Token span masking was chosen for the denoising task because it allows the model to learn to recover larger segments of text, which is more representative of natural language. This approach enhances the model's ability to understand context and relationships between words, leading to improved generation quality.

### 11. Choice of Hyperparameters for Training (e.g., Learning Rate, Batch Size)
The choice of hyperparameters is critical for optimizing model performance. The researchers likely selected hyperparameters based on empirical results from previous studies and experiments, aiming to achieve a balance between convergence speed and model generalization. The learning rate and batch size were tuned to ensure effective training on the large-scale datasets.

### 12. Decision to Focus on Long-Term Dependencies in Token Prediction
Focusing on long-term dependencies is essential for generating coherent and contextually
