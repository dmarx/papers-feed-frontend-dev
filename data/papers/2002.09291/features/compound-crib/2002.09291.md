### Detailed Technical Explanations for the Transformer Hawkes Process (THP)

#### Problem Statement
Traditional Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based point process models face significant challenges in capturing both short-term and long-term temporal dependencies in event sequence data. This limitation arises from the inherent structure of RNNs, which process sequences in a stepwise manner, leading to difficulties in retaining information over long time intervals. The vanishing gradient problem exacerbates this issue, making it hard for RNNs to learn from events that are temporally distant from the current event being processed. Consequently, RNNs often yield unreliable predictions in scenarios where complex temporal dynamics are present, such as in social media interactions, financial transactions, and healthcare event sequences.

#### Proposed Model: Transformer Hawkes Process (THP)
The Transformer Hawkes Process (THP) is introduced as a solution to the limitations of RNN-based models. By leveraging the self-attention mechanism inherent in Transformer architectures, THP can effectively model both short-term and long-term dependencies in event sequences. The self-attention mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of all past events when predicting the occurrence of future events, regardless of their temporal distance. This capability is crucial for accurately capturing the dynamics of event sequences, where the influence of past events can vary significantly over time.

#### Key Advantages of THP
1. **Captures Long-Term Dependencies**: The self-attention mechanism enables THP to assign varying levels of importance to past events, allowing it to capture long-term dependencies more effectively than RNNs. This is particularly beneficial in domains where historical events have a prolonged influence on future occurrences.

2. **Parallel Processing**: Unlike RNNs, which process events sequentially, THP allows for parallel processing of events. This parallelism significantly enhances computational efficiency and scalability, making it feasible to handle large datasets with numerous events.

3. **Deeper Model Training**: The non-recurrent structure of THP facilitates the training of deeper models. Deeper architectures can capture more complex dependencies and interactions within the data, leading to improved predictive performance. In contrast, RNNs are often limited to shallow architectures due to training difficulties associated with gradient issues.

#### Hawkes Process Overview
The Hawkes process is a type of point process characterized by its intensity function, which models the rate of event occurrences over time. The intensity function is defined as:
\[
\lambda(t) = \mu + \sum_{j:t_j < t} \psi(t - t_j)
\]
where \(\mu\) represents the base intensity, and \(\psi(\cdot)\) is a decaying function that captures the influence of past events on the current event's occurrence. This formulation allows for the modeling of self-exciting behavior, where past events can increase the likelihood of future events.

#### Neural Hawkes Process
The Neural Hawkes Process extends the classical Hawkes process by using RNNs to parameterize the intensity function:
\[
\lambda(t) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \lambda_k(t) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} f_k(w_k h(t))
\]
Here, \(f_k(\cdot)\) is a softplus function, and \(h(t)\) represents the hidden states of the RNN. While this approach improves the flexibility of the model, it inherits the limitations of RNNs, particularly in capturing long-term dependencies and training deep architectures.

#### Self-Attention Mechanism
The self-attention mechanism in THP assigns attention scores to model dependencies among events. This allows the model to adaptively select relevant past events based on their temporal distance and importance, enabling it to capture complex relationships in the data. The attention scores are computed based on the embeddings of the events, allowing the model to focus on the most influential events when predicting future occurrences.

#### Temporal Encoding
To incorporate temporal information into the model, THP employs a temporal encoding scheme:
\[
[z(t_j)]_i = 
\begin{cases} 
\cos\left(\frac{t_j}{10000^{\frac{i-1}{M}}}\right) & \text{if } i \text{ is odd} \\ 
\sin\left(\frac{t_j}{10000^{\frac{i}{M}}}\right) & \text{if } i \text{ is even} 
\end{cases}
\]
This encoding captures the timing of events in a way that is compatible with the self-attention mechanism, allowing the model to consider both the event type and its occurrence time when making predictions.

#### Model Extensions
THP can be extended to incorporate relational graphs, enabling the modeling of multiple point processes. By leveraging structural knowledge from relational graphs, THP can improve prediction performance by capturing interactions between different event sequences. This is particularly useful in social networks, where the relationships between users can significantly influence event dynamics.

#### Experimental Results
Numerical experiments demonstrate that THP outperforms RNN-based models
