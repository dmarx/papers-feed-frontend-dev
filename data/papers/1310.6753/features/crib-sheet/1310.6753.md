- **Key Concept: Tie Strength**
  - Definition: Informal measure of 'closeness' in friendships, ranging from strong ties (close friends) to weak ties (distant acquaintances).
  
- **New Measure: Dispersion**
  - Definition: A measure of tie strength that assesses the extent to which mutual friends of two individuals are not well-connected to each other.
  - Formula: 
    \[
    disp(u, v) = \sum_{s,t \in C_{uv}} d_v(s, t)
    \]
    where \(C_{uv}\) is the set of common neighbors of \(u\) and \(v\), and \(d_v\) is a distance function on the nodes of \(C_{uv}\).

- **Comparison with Embeddedness**
  - Embeddedness: Number of mutual friends shared by two individuals.
  - Performance: Embeddedness achieves a baseline accuracy of 24.7% in identifying romantic partners.
  - Dispersion: Achieves over 60% accuracy for married users, significantly outperforming embeddedness.

- **Importance of Romantic Relationships**
  - Romantic ties are among the strongest social ties and have unique structural properties that differ from standard embeddedness measures.

- **Data Source**
  - Analyzed data from approximately 1.3 million Facebook users with declared relationship partners, focusing on users aged 20 and above.

- **Methodology**
  - Task: Identify a user's romantic partner based solely on their network structure.
  - Evaluation: Compare accuracy of dispersion against embeddedness and other interaction measures.

- **Findings**
  - Dispersion is more effective than embeddedness for identifying romantic partners.
  - Gender differences exist in the recognizability of relationship partners from network structure.
  - Relationships scoring high on the dispersion measure are more likely to persist.

- **Implications**
  - The introduction of dispersion broadens the analytical tools for understanding tie strength in online social networks.
  - Suggests a need for a synthesis of structural and interaction-based perspectives in studying online relationships.

- **Conclusion**
  - The study provides a new framework for understanding the structural characteristics of romantic relationships in social networks, emphasizing the role of dispersion in identifying strong ties.
