  "title": "Romantic Partnerships and the Dispersion of Social Ties: A Network\n  Analysis of Relationship Status on Facebook",
  "authors": "Lars Backstrom, Jon Kleinberg",
  "abstract": "A crucial task in the analysis of on-line social-networking systems is to\nidentify important people --- those linked by strong social ties --- within an\nindividual's network neighborhood. Here we investigate this question for a\nparticular category of strong ties, those involving spouses or romantic\npartners. We organize our analysis around a basic question: given all the\nconnections among a person's friends, can you recognize his or her romantic\npartner from the network structure alone? Using data from a large sample of\nFacebook users, we find that this task can be accomplished with high accuracy,\nbut doing so requires the development of a new measure of tie strength that we\nterm `dispersion' --- the extent to which two people's mutual friends are not\nthemselves well-connected. The results offer methods for identifying types of\nstructurally significant people in on-line applications, and suggest a\npotential expansion of existing theories of tie strength.",
