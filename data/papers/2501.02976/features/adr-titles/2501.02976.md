- Decision to integrate text-to-video models for improved temporal modeling in video super-resolution.
- Choice of Local Information Enhancement Module (LIEM) to address degradation artifacts.
- Implementation of Dynamic Frequency (DF) Loss to enhance fidelity in video restoration.
- Selection of VAE, text encoder, ControlNet, and T2V model as core components of the STAR framework.
- Decision to prioritize local detail recovery over global information extraction in the model architecture.
- Choice of loss functions and their weighting in the optimization process.
- Adoption of extensive experiments to validate the performance of STAR against state-of-the-art methods.
- Decision to focus on real-world video super-resolution challenges rather than synthetic scenarios.
- Choice of datasets for training and evaluation of the proposed model.
- Decision to utilize a two-stage approach in the T2V model for generating high-resolution outputs.
