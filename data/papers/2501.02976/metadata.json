  "abstract": "Image diffusion models have been adapted for real-world video\nsuper-resolution to tackle over-smoothing issues in GAN-based methods. However,\nthese models struggle to maintain temporal consistency, as they are trained on\nstatic images, limiting their ability to capture temporal dynamics effectively.\nIntegrating text-to-video (T2V) models into video super-resolution for improved\ntemporal modeling is straightforward. However, two key challenges remain:\nartifacts introduced by complex degradations in real-world scenarios, and\ncompromised fidelity due to the strong generative capacity of powerful T2V\nmodels (\\textit{e.g.}, CogVideoX-5B). To enhance the spatio-temporal quality of\nrestored videos, we introduce\\textbf{~\\name}\n(\\textbf{S}patial-\\textbf{T}emporal \\textbf{A}ugmentation with T2V models for\n\\textbf{R}eal-world video super-resolution), a novel approach that leverages\nT2V models for real-world video super-resolution, achieving realistic spatial\ndetails and robust temporal consistency. Specifically, we introduce a Local\nInformation Enhancement Module (LIEM) before the global attention block to\nenrich local details and mitigate degradation artifacts. Moreover, we propose a\nDynamic Frequency (DF) Loss to reinforce fidelity, guiding the model to focus\non different frequency components across diffusion steps.
