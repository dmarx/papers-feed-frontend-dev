- **NEUROGAME Framework**: Merges game theory (GT) and statistical mechanics (SM) for deep learning, enhancing feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and pattern classification.
  
- **Neurons as Players**: Each neuron in a neural network is analogous to a player in a cooperative game, with activation values representing strategies.

- **Sequential Game Interpretation**: The feed-forward process in deep learning is modeled as a sequential game where neurons are evaluated based on their contributions to a payoff function.

- **Payoff Function**: The contribution of each neuron is quantified using the Shapley value, derived from an energy function, determining which neurons propagate information to subsequent layers.

- **Winning Coalition**: Neurons forming coalitions with high payoffs are deemed winning coalitions, allowing only these to transmit information forward.

- **Probabilistic Signal Transmission**: Information flow across layers follows a Gibbs distribution, ensuring that lower energy configurations are more probable.

- **Energy Function**: The energy of a configuration state is modeled using the Ising model, expressed as:
  \[
  E(ω) = \langle p,q \rangle b_{pq} \times \frac{1}{a_p} \times \frac{1}{a_q} + \sum_{p} f_p \times \frac{1}{a_p}
  \]

- **Gibbs Distribution**: Defined as:
  \[
  P(ω_i, T) = \frac{1}{Q} e^{-\frac{E(ω_i)}{k_B \times T}}
  \]
  where \( Q \) is the partition function, \( k_B \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

- **Shapley Value Calculation**: The Shapley value for player \( i \) in a coalition is given by:
  \[
  ϕ_i(N, v) = \frac{1}{n!} \sum_{C \subseteq N \setminus \{i\}} |C|!(n - |C| - 1)! [v(C \cup \{i\}) - v(C)]
  \]

- **Coalition Definition**: A coalition \( C \subseteq N \) cooperates to achieve a common goal, with payoffs \( v(C) \) that can be redistributed among members.

- **Neurons Neighborhood System**: Defined for a neuron in a (3,3) grid, crucial for evaluating energy and payoff functions.

- **Applications**: Demonstrated effectiveness in facial age estimation and gender classification, outperforming traditional models like multi-layer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks.
