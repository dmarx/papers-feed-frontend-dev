The research conducted by Mosin et al. (2023) on vocabulary transfer in biomedical NLP presents a comprehensive approach to enhancing model performance through strategic vocabulary adaptation. Below is a detailed technical explanation of the decisions made by the researchers regarding various aspects of their study.

### Vocabulary Transfer Concept

The **Vocabulary Transfer Concept** introduced by Mosin et al. is predicated on the idea that adapting the vocabulary during the fine-tuning phase can significantly improve the performance of language models on specific tasks. This is particularly relevant in the biomedical domain, where the language used can be highly specialized and diverges from general English. By allowing the model to learn from a vocabulary that is more representative of the target domain, the researchers aim to bridge the gap between the pre-trained model's knowledge and the specific requirements of biomedical tasks.

### Tokenization Strategy

The researchers employed a **tokenization strategy** that distinguishes between the original vocabulary \( V \) (comprising \( M \) tokens) and a new vocabulary \( V' \) (comprising \( N \) tokens). This custom tokenization during fine-tuning is crucial because it allows the model to better capture the nuances of biomedical language, which often includes complex terms, acronyms, and specialized jargon. The decision to implement a new vocabulary reflects an understanding that the original tokenization may not adequately represent the specificities of the biomedical texts, thus necessitating a tailored approach.

### Token Initialization Heuristics

The researchers explored two **token initialization heuristics** for transferring knowledge from the original vocabulary to the new vocabulary:

1. **Matched Vocabulary Transfer**: This heuristic directly matches tokens from the original vocabulary to the new vocabulary. If a token in the new vocabulary exists in the original vocabulary, its embedding is directly transferred. This approach is straightforward and ensures that well-represented tokens retain their learned embeddings.

2. **Averaged Transfer**: For new tokens that do not have a direct match, this heuristic decomposes them into partitions of original tokens and averages their embeddings for initialization. This method allows for a more nuanced representation of new tokens, leveraging the embeddings of related tokens to create a more informed initialization. This decision reflects a desire to maintain the semantic integrity of the new vocabulary while ensuring that it is grounded in the knowledge captured during pre-training.

### Impact of Vocabulary Size

The researchers found that **increasing vocabulary size** generally leads to improved classifier accuracy. Their experiments demonstrated that reducing the vocabulary size from 16,000 to 8,000 tokens resulted in a minor accuracy decrease of 0.26% for VIPI alone, while MLM+VIPI showed a more significant decline of 4.03%. Conversely, increasing the vocabulary size to 32,000 tokens resulted in a 2.16% improvement with MLM+VIPI. This finding underscores the importance of vocabulary size in capturing the complexity of biomedical language and suggests that a larger vocabulary can provide the model with more expressive power, thereby enhancing its performance.

### Masked Language Modeling (MLM)

The use of **Masked Language Modeling (MLM)** is a critical component of the researchers' approach. MLM serves as an intermediary step that allows the model to adapt to the new dataset-specific tokenization. By training the model on masked tokens, it learns to predict missing words based on context, which enhances its understanding of the relationships between tokens in the biomedical domain. This step is essential for improving model performance and reducing inference time, as it prepares the model to leverage the new vocabulary effectively.

### Inference Time Considerations

The researchers acknowledged that **inference time** is a crucial factor in the medical domain, where timely decision-making can be critical. They found that larger vocabulary sizes generally increase inference time; however, incorporating MLM allows for efficient handling of domain-specific vocabularies, optimizing inference speed. This decision reflects a balance between model performance and practical considerations in real-world applications, emphasizing the need for rapid processing in healthcare settings.

### Experimental Datasets

The choice of **experimental datasets** (OHSUMED and Kaggle Medical Texts Dataset) was strategic, as these datasets are representative of the challenges faced in biomedical text classification. By using diverse datasets with varying labels and records, the researchers aimed to validate their findings across different contexts, ensuring that the benefits of vocabulary transfer are not limited to a single dataset or task.

### Classifier Accuracy Changes

The researchers provided a detailed analysis of **classifier accuracy changes** in relation to vocabulary size adjustments and the impact of MLM. The results indicated that while reducing vocabulary size can lead to accuracy declines, increasing vocabulary size, particularly when combined with MLM, can yield significant improvements. This analysis highlights the importance of both vocabulary size and the training methodology in achieving optimal model performance.

### Conclusion and Limitations

In conclusion, the study demonstrates that vocabulary transfer in biomedical NLP can significantly enhance model performance, especially when combined with MLM and vocabulary extension. However, the researchers also acknowledged limitations, such as the focus on the BERT model and specific datasets, suggesting that further research is needed to explore the applicability of their findings to larger models and other
