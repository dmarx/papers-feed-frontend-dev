- **Vocabulary Transfer Concept**: Introduced by Mosin et al. (2023), involves adapting vocabulary during fine-tuning to improve model performance on specific tasks.
  
- **Tokenization Strategy**: Original vocabulary \( V \) consists of \( M \) tokens; new vocabulary \( V' \) consists of \( N \) tokens. Custom tokenization during fine-tuning enhances task-specific performance.

- **Token Initialization Heuristics**:
  - **Matched Vocabulary Transfer**: Directly matches tokens from original vocabulary to new vocabulary.
  - **Averaged Transfer**: Decomposes new tokens into partitions of original tokens, averaging their embeddings for initialization.

- **Impact of Vocabulary Size**:
  - Increasing vocabulary size improves classifier accuracy.
  - Example: Reducing vocabulary from 16,000 to 8,000 tokens results in a minor accuracy decrease of 0.26% for VIPI alone, while MLM+VIPI shows a decline of 4.03%.

- **Masked Language Modeling (MLM)**: 
  - Essential for adapting to new dataset-specific tokenization.
  - Enhances model performance and reduces inference time when used with vocabulary transfer.

- **Inference Time Considerations**: 
  - Larger vocabulary sizes generally increase inference time.
  - Incorporating MLM allows efficient handling of domain-specific vocabularies, optimizing inference speed.

- **Experimental Datasets**:
  - **OHSUMED**: 13,929 records, 23 labels (cardiovascular diseases).
  - **Kaggle Medical Texts Dataset**: 28,880 records, 5 labels (various patient conditions).

- **Classifier Accuracy Changes**:
  - Table summarizing accuracy changes with vocabulary size adjustments and the impact of MLM:
    - \( 16,000 \to 8,000 \): -0.26% (VIPI), -4.03% (MLM+VIPI)
    - \( 16,000 \to 32,000 \): -1.24% (VIPI), +2.16% (MLM+VIPI)
    - \( 16,000 \to 64,000 \): -3.45% (VIPI), +2.51% (MLM+VIPI)

- **Conclusion**: Vocabulary transfer in biomedical NLP can significantly enhance model performance, particularly when combined with MLM and vocabulary extension.

- **Limitations**: Study limited to BERT model and specific datasets; effects may vary with larger models.
