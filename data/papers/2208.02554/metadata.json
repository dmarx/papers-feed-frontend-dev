  "abstract": "Working within specific NLP subdomains presents significant challenges,\nprimarily due to a persistent deficit of data. Stringent privacy concerns and\nlimited data accessibility often drive this shortage. Additionally, the medical\ndomain demands high accuracy, where even marginal improvements in model\nperformance can have profound impacts. In this study, we investigate the\npotential of vocabulary transfer to enhance model performance in biomedical NLP\ntasks. Specifically, we focus on vocabulary extension, a technique that\ninvolves expanding the target vocabulary to incorporate domain-specific\nbiomedical terms. Our findings demonstrate that vocabulary extension, leads to\nmeasurable improvements in both downstream model performance and inference\ntime.",
