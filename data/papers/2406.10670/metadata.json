  "abstract": "Selecting high-quality data for pre-training is crucial in shaping the\ndownstream task performance of language models. A major challenge lies in\nidentifying this optimal subset, a problem generally considered intractable,\nthus necessitating scalable and effective heuristics. In this work, we propose\na data selection method, CoLoR-Filter (Conditional Loss Reduction Filtering),\nwhich leverages an empirical Bayes-inspired approach to derive a simple and\ncomputationally efficient selection criterion based on the relative loss values\nof two auxiliary models.\n  In addition to the modeling rationale, we evaluate CoLoR-Filter empirically\non two language modeling tasks: (1) selecting data from C4 for domain\nadaptation to evaluation on Books and (2) selecting data from C4 for a suite of\ndownstream multiple-choice question answering tasks. We demonstrate favorable\nscaling both as we subselect more aggressively and using small auxiliary models\nto select data for large target models. As one headline result, CoLoR-Filter\ndata selected using a pair of 150m parameter auxiliary models can train a 1.2b\nparameter target model to match a 1.2b parameter model trained on 25b randomly\nselected tokens with 25x less data for Books and 11x less data for the\ndownstream tasks.\n  Code: https://github.com/davidbrandfonbrener/color-filter-olmo\n  Filtered data:\nhttps://huggingface.co/datasets/davidbrandfonbrener/color-filtered-c4",
