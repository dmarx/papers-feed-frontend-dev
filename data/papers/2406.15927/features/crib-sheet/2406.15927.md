- **Semantic Entropy Probes (SEPs)**: A method for detecting hallucinations in LLMs by approximating semantic entropy from hidden states of a single generation.
  
- **Hallucinations in LLMs**: Defined as plausible-sounding but factually incorrect outputs, posing risks in high-stakes applications.

- **Semantic Entropy (SE)**: Measures uncertainty in model outputs by clustering generations into sets of equivalent meaning and estimating uncertainty in semantic space.

- **Key Advantages of SEPs**:
  - **Cost-Effective**: Reduces computational overhead by eliminating the need for multiple model generations (5-10x cost reduction).
  - **High Performance**: Retains effectiveness in hallucination detection and generalizes better to out-of-distribution data compared to previous methods.

- **Training SEPs**: 
  - SEPs are trained on hidden states rather than requiring labeled datasets for accuracy, making them easier to deploy.
  - They predict semantic entropy instead of model accuracy, allowing for effective uncertainty quantification.

- **Ablation Studies**: Show that hidden states across various models, tasks, layers, and token positions capture semantic uncertainty, providing insights into LLM behavior.

- **Performance Metrics**: SEPs outperform accuracy probes in hallucination detection, establishing a new state-of-the-art for cost-efficient methods.

- **Semantic Clustering Process**:
  1. Sample model completions for a given query.
  2. Use natural language inference (NLI) models to cluster generations based on semantic equivalence.
  3. Calculate semantic entropy \( H_{SE} \) by aggregating uncertainties within each cluster.

- **Implications for LLM Deployment**: Reliable detection of hallucinations is crucial for safe use in sensitive domains like medicine and journalism.
