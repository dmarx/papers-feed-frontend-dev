<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We provide a distillation scaling law that estimates distilled model performance based on a compute budget and its allocation between the student and teacher. Our findings reduce the risks associated with using distillation at scale; compute allocation for both the teacher and student models can now be done to maximize student performance. We provide compute optimal distillation recipes for when 1) a teacher exists, or 2) a teacher needs training. If many students are to be distilled, or a teacher already exists, distillation outperforms supervised pretraining until a compute level which grows predictably with student size. If one student is to be distilled and a teacher also needs training, supervised learning should be done instead. Additionally, we provide insights across our large scale study of distillation, which increase our understanding of distillation and inform experimental design.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The study of scaling laws <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Hestness et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Rosenfeld et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Kaplan et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hoffmann et al., 2022)</ref> revealed that previously trained Language Models (LMs) could have been more capable if they had followed a compute optimal training paradigm, which determines the model size and the number of training tokens that give the best performing model under a given compute budget. Many subsequent works have followed compute optimal training <ref type="bibr">(Dey et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Muennighoff et al., 2023b)</ref>.</p><p>The size of compute optimal models grows with compute <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hoffmann et al., 2022)</ref>, which makes them challenging to use due to the growth in inference costs. In practice, this means compute optimal models are slow, expensive to serve, consume more battery life, provide high barriers Preprint. to entry for academic study, and have a significant carbon footprint. With inference volume up to billions of tokens per day <ref type="bibr">(OpenAI &amp; Pilipiszyn, 2021)</ref>, the inference cost of an LM is typically significantly larger than its pretraining cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Chien et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wu et al., 2024a)</ref> and is going to further increase in an era of test-time compute scaling <ref type="bibr">(Snell et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Brown et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wu et al., 2024b)</ref>.</p><p>Unsustainable inference costs have led to an alternative training paradigm, overtraining <ref type="bibr">(Gadre et al., 2024)</ref>, where the amount of training data used is much greater than in the compute optimal case, enabling small, capable models. Overtrained models better satisfy compute optimality when compute is measured over a model's lifetime, rather than just the pretraining cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Sardana et al., 2024)</ref>. As supervised scaling laws follow power laws in model size and training data, diminishing returns in performance oc-cur much sooner than in the compute-optimal case. To achieve reasonable capabilities, these models need to be trained on many trillions of tokens, <ref type="bibr">(Snell et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Brown et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wu et al., 2024b)</ref>, which is expensive and time-consuming.</p><p>We seek models that match the performance of small overtrained models but at lower training cost. A popular candidate is distillation <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Hinton et al., 2015)</ref>, where a capable teacher LM produces targets for a smaller student LM. When distillation is used for LM pretraining, we will call this distillation pretraining. There are many explanations for why distillation works, from dark knowledge transfer, where information is contained in the ratio of probabilities of incorrect classes <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Hinton et al., 2015)</ref>, to being a form of regularization <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Mobahi et al., 2020)</ref>, or reducing noise in the learning process <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Menon et al., 2020)</ref>, among many other explanations. Despite a lack of consensus for why distillation works, distillation pretraining has produced more capable models than supervised pretraining in the Gemma and Gemini <ref type="bibr">(Rivière et al., 2024)</ref>, Minitron <ref type="bibr">(Muralidharan et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sreenivas et al., 2024)</ref> and AFM <ref type="bibr">(Gunter et al., 2024)</ref> families of LMs in terms of both pretraining loss and downstream evaluations. Yet, at the same time, <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Liu et al. (2024)</ref> reported that distillation produces less capable models than supervised pretraining does.</p><p>With such significant compute resources being devoted to distillation pretraining of LMs, it is essential to understand how to correctly allocate these resources, to produce the most capable models possible, and to have an understanding if any gains are even possible compared to supervised pretraining when both methods have access to the same resources <ref type="bibr">(Dehghani et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>To close this knowledge gap, we perform an extensive controlled study of distillation, with students and teachers ranging from 143M to 12.6B parameters, trained on data of a few billion tokens, up to 512B tokens. These experiments result in our distillation scaling law, which estimates student performance as a function of resources (the teacher, the student size, and the amount of data used for distillation), resolving questions about when distillation is and is not effective in terms of producing models of a desired capability under resource constraints of interest. We find:</p><p>1. The cross entropy of a student of size N S distilled on D S tokens from a teacher of size N T trained on D T tokens can be predicted using our distillation scaling law (Equation <ref type="formula">8</ref>).</p><p>2. The teacher size N T and number of teacher training tokens D T determines the student cross-entropy only through their determination of the teacher's crossentropy L T = L T (N T , D T ) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</p><p>3. The influence of the teacher cross-entropy upon the student loss follows a power law which transitions between two behaviors depending on the relative learning capacities of student and the teacher, reflecting a phenomenon in distillation called the capacity gap, where a stronger teacher produces a worse student.</p><p>Our parameterization resolves outstanding questions about the capacity gap, showing that it is a gap in learning capacity (both hypothesis space and ability to optimize) between the teacher and student, and not only about their relative sizes, which is a special case.</p><p>Our results show that distillation can not produce lower model cross-entropies than supervised learning when both learning processes are given enough data or compute. However, distillation is more efficient than supervised learning if both of the following are true:</p><p>1. The total compute or tokens used for the student is not larger than student size-dependent threshold given by our scaling law (Section 5.1).</p><p>2. A teacher already exists, or the teacher to be trained has uses beyond a single distillation (Section 5.3).</p><p>We hope the laws and analyses we provide will guide the community to produce even more capable models with lower inference cost and lower lifetime compute costs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Background</head><p>Predicting model performance is essential when scaling as it lets us understand i) the value of increasing the available compute (C), and ii) how that compute should be distributed, typically between model parameters (N ) and data (D), in order to achieve a model with desired properties. These properties may be predicting the data distribution sufficiently well, measured in cross-entropy (L), or achieving a level of performance on downstream tasks of interest.</p><p>Fortunately, cross-entropy is predictable, with substantial empirical and theoretical evidence that L follows a powerlaw in parameters N and data D (measured in tokens)</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Distillation Scaling Laws</head><p>Here we outline the steps taken to arrive at our distillation scaling law. First we describe the experimental setting (Section 4.1) and the experiments needed to determine the scaling coefficients (Section 4.2). Given the empirical observations, we discuss the form our distillation scaling law takes (Section 4.3), find the coefficients, and verify the law under extrapolation (Section 4.4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Experimental setup</head><p>All models are based on <ref type="bibr">Gunter et al. (2024)</ref> and use decoupled weight decay <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Loshchilov &amp; Hutter (2019)</ref> for regularization, as well as a simplified version of µP <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Yang &amp; Hu, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yang &amp; Littwin, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Yang et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wortsman et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Yang et al., 2023)</ref>, following µP (simple) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Wortsman et al., 2024)</ref>. µP simplifies the scaling law experimental setup as it enables hyperparameter transfer of the learning rate across model sizes. We validate that µP functions as expected for distillation in Appendix G.3. DS The number of tokens the student is distilled on. M ≡ D/N The tokens per parameter ratio, or M -ratio. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hoffmann et al. (2022)</ref>, M takes a compute optimal value M * ≈ 20 which is the Chinchilla rule of thumb. L ≈ L(N, D) The model cross-entropy, which is the model validation cross entropy under data, estimated by the supervised scaling law for a model with N parameters trained on D tokens. (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>). LT ≈ L(NT , DT ) The teacher cross-entropy, which is the teacher validation cross entropy under data, estimated by the supervised scaling law for a teacher with NT parameters trained on DT tokens. LS ≈ LS(NS, DS, LT ) The student cross-entropy, which is the student validation cross entropy under data, estimated by our distillation scaling law for a student with NS parameters distilled on DS tokens using a teacher with pretraining loss LT (Equation <ref type="formula">8</ref>).</p><p>LS ≈ L(NS, DS) The student supervised cross-entropy, which is the student validation cross entropy under data if the student had been trained in a supervised way, estimated by the supervised scaling law for a student with NS parameters trained on DS tokens.</p><p>Models have sizes which range from 143M to 12.6B parameters, and we allow the teacher to be smaller or larger than the student. Multi-headed attention (MHA) is used, with Pre-Normalization <ref type="bibr">(Nguyen &amp; Salazar, 2019)</ref> using RMSNorm <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Zhang &amp; Sennrich, 2019)</ref>. We train all models with a sequence length of 4096, with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) <ref type="bibr">(Su et al., 2024)</ref>. We use the Englishonly subset of the C4 dataset <ref type="bibr">(Raffel et al., 2020)</ref> for all experiments. For all distillation trainings, the teacher is trained on a different split from the student. Except for the largest models, all Chinchilla-optimal models do not repeat data. Full hyperparameters and details can be found in Appendix I. As our goal is to understand the role of the teacher in the distillation process we distill in the pure distillation case (λ = 1, Equation <ref type="formula">7</ref>) to avoid confounding coming from the data, as was done in <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Stanton et al. (2021)</ref>. We verify the choice λ = 1 produces results statistically similar to the optimal λ * (see Appendix G.1). Similarly, all experiments use distillation temperature (τ = 1), as we found this produces the best performing students (see Appendix G.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Distillation Scaling Law Experiments</head><p>Here we discuss the experiments that produce the data for fitting our distillation scaling law. The distillation scaling law will estimate student cross-entropy L S 3 , which in general depends on the student parameters N S , number of distillation tokens D S , the teacher parameters N T and the number of teacher training tokens N T : L S ≈ L S (N S , D S , N T , D T ). As discussed in Section 2, only certain combinations of data support reliable identification of scaling law coefficients. We combine three experimental 3 By cross-entropy, we always mean with respect to data, not the teacher. We summarize our scaling law notation in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. protocols to produce data for our distillation scaling law fit.</p><p>100M 300M 1B 3B 7B 2.25 2.50 Student Cross-Entropy L S Teacher N T =975M 100M 300M 1B 3B 7B</p><p>Teacher N T =7.75B Student Parameters N S Student FLOPs 3 × 10 19 10 20 3 × 10 20 10 21 3 × 10 21 Figure 2. Fixed M Teacher/Student IsoFLOP profiles. Two (of a total of six) teachers with MT = DT /NT ≈ 20 are distilled into students with four IsoFLOP profiles, and a small number with CS = 3 × 10 21 . Horizontal and vertical dashed lines indicate teacher cross entropy LT and size NT respectively. See Appendix E.4, Figure 38a for all six profiles.</p><p>Fixed M Teachers/Student IsoFLOPs To simplify the experimental protocol we make the following assumption: Training a student (N S , D S ) on the signal provided by a teacher (N T , D T ) is qualitatively similar to training that student on fixed dataset. As power law behavior has been observed in a wide variety of datasets and domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Henighan et al., 2020)</ref>, it is expected that there should be a power law behavior in (N S , D S ) given a fixed teacher.</p><p>To identify these coefficients correctly, a similar protocol to the Chinchilla protocol described in Section 2 should be performed. However, we cannot only do this for only one teacher, as the way student size and tokens affects downstream performance may be different for different teachers, just as the scaling laws are different for different domains and dataset. For distillation we anticipate this is the case so that different teachers produce different students. To produce the widest range of teachers for a compute budget, we train six Chinchilla-optimal (M T = D T /N T ≈ 20) teachers ranging from 198M to 7.75B parameters. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">4</ref> For each of those teachers, we distill into students with four IsoFLOP profiles, taking only the standard training cost into account. The resulting student cross-entropies are in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. We note that in some cases, the student is able to outperform the teacher, i.e. exhibits weak-to-stronggeneralization <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Burns et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ildiz et al., 2024)</ref> and investigate this further in Appendix E.7.

We perform distillations into four Chinchilla-optimal (M S = D S /N S ≈ 20) students ranging from 198M to 1.82B parameters from teachers trained according to four IsoFLOP profiles. The resulting student cross-entropies are in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>.</p><p>Fixed M Teachers/Fixed M Students Finally, although not necessary for fitting our distillation scaling law, it is instructive to see how student cross entropies vary over as large a range as possible. To achieve this, we train fixed-M teacher fixed-M student combinations, with ten teachers with M T ≈ 20, and students of five sizes, with at least four choices of M S per student. The resulting student cross-entropies for two of the students are in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Capacity gap</head><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, we observe the capacity gap, where improving teacher performance does not always improve student performance, and even reduces student performance eventually. The capacity gap has been observed often in distillation (see <ref type="bibr">Appendix B.3</ref>). The KLD between teacher and student is an increasing function of teacher capability in all cases (see Appendix E.3), which means as the teacher improves its own performance, the student finds the teacher more challenging to model, eventually preventing the student from taking advantage of teacher gains. We use calibration metrics to investigate aspects that the student finds challenging to model in Appendix E.8. In Appendices C.1 and C.2 we offer a simple explanation in a kernel regression and synthetic Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) setting and, to the best our knowledge, are the first controlled demonstrations of the capacity gap.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Distillation Scaling Law Functional Form</head><p>We need to determine the functional form of the distillation scaling law. First, we observe that contributions from teacher size N T and pretraining tokens D T are summarized by the teacher cross-entropy L T . This can be seen from Figures 1 and 3b which contains the IsoFLOP Teacher/Fixed M Students of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, yet only smooth dependence as a function of L T is observed. Next, the distillation scaling law should reflect the following properties:</p><p>1. An infinitely capable student should be able to model any teacher:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">lim N S ,D S →∞ L S (N S , D S , L T ) → L T .</formula><p>2. A random teacher produces random students independent of how capable those students are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">lim L T →∞ L S (N S , D S , L T ) → L T .</formula><p>3. There is a capacity gap: making a teacher too capable eventually reduces the student performance.</p><p>A transition between two power law regions: i) where the student is a stronger learner than the teacher, and ii) where the student is a weaker learner than the teacher is described by a broken power law <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Caballero et al., 2023)</ref>. Together, we propose that student cross-entropy follows a broken power law in L T and a power law in N S and D S :</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">L S (N S ,D S ,L T ) Student cross-entropy = L T Teacher cross-entropy + 1 L c0 T 1+ L T L S d 1 1/f1 -c1f1 A N α ′ S + B D β ′ S γ ′</formula><p>Student ability to mimic teacher <ref type="bibr">(8)</ref> where {c 0 , c 1 , d 1 , f 1 , α ′ , β ′ , γ ′ } are positive coefficients to be fitted following the procedure outlined in Appendix F.2 on the data produced in Section 4.2. The first two properties of our distillation scaling law can be readily checked.</p><p>For the third, recall, L S = L(N S , D S ) is the cross-entropy a student would have achieved if it had been trained in a supervised way (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), and is determinable from the supervised scaling law (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>). The capacity gap behavior follows from a transition based on the ratio of the algorithmic learning capacities of the student and teacher, when L T / L S ≡ L(N T , D T )/L(N S , D S ) = d 1 , which can be interpreted as measure of the relative learning abilities of the teacher and the student on a reference task.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Distillation scaling law applications</head><p>Here, we apply our distillation scaling law (Equation <ref type="formula">8</ref>) and investigate scenarios of interest. Typically, the resources in distillation pretraining include a compute budget, or a dataset containing a number of tokens. For a distillation process, the compute cost can be approximated by where δ Lgt T , δ Pre T ∈ [0, 1] indicate if we account for the cost of teacher logit inference for the student targets<ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">foot_5</ref> , and teacher pretraining cost in the total compute budget (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">2</ref>). F (N ) is the number of Floating Operations (FLOPs) a model with N parameters performs during a forward pass. F (N ) ≈ 2N is often used, giving supervised FLOPs ≈ 6N D. We cannot use the 2N approximation, as i) using non-embedding parameters N induces systematic errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Porian et al., 2024)</ref>, and ii) we are interested in small models with large context sizes where the FLOP contribution from attention is significant. To resolve these issues. we derive a simple expression F (N ) ≈ 2N (1+c 1 N -1/3 +c 2 N -2/3 ) for fixed-aspect ratio models Appendix H.1, and recommend the scaling community to consider adopting this hyperparameter setting.</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">FLOPs≈3F (N S )D S Student Training +F (N T )(δ Lgt T D S Teacher Logits +δ Pre T 3D T Teacher Training ) (9)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Fixed tokens or compute (best case)</head><p>To build intuition for when distillation may (and may not) be beneficial, we ask how well can distillation do in the best case scenario, compared with supervised learning? We superimpose the data of Figures 2 and 3 onto contours of distilled cross-entropy L S compared to a supervised model with the same resources L S (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supervised learning always outperforms distillation</head><p>given enough student compute or tokens. For a modest token budget, distillation is favorable, however, when a large number of tokens are available, supervised learning outperforms distillation. This is expected; in the large data regime, supervised learning can find the best solution limited by model size N (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>), whereas distillation only finds this solution for the optimal teacher L * T (see Appendix E.6), and is otherwise limited by the distillation process. This finding appears to contradict the patient teacher finding of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Beyer et al. (2022)</ref>. A comment on this contradiction is provided in Appendix D.1. Student compute constrained version of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> and IsoFLOP Teacher/Fixed M student contours are provided in Appendix D.2. </p></div>

A larger teacher may provide a better learning signal (lower cross-entropy) but will also be more expensive to use because of the teacher logits cost (Equation 9, δ Lgt T = 1), inducing a trade-off.

Here, the compute cost from N T is not relevant as we are considering a token budget. Student cross-entropy at different distillation token budgets is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>. An equivalent plot for different student sizes whilst varying tokens is shown in Appendix D.3. We see that the optimal teacher loss L * T (red line) decreases as a power law with student size N S until L S matches L * T , when there is an inflection point in L * T , causing the decrease of teacher loss to sharpen with N S . This generalizes the observation of <ref type="bibr">Zhang et al. (2023a)</ref>, that "Optimal teacher scale almost consistently follows a linear scaling with the student scale across different model architectures and data scales." which is a special case of our finding when the teachers are compute optimal (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_30">36a</ref>).

Conversely, if the intention is to distill into a family of models, or use the teacher as a server model, distillation may be more computationally beneficial than supervised learning.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>We provide a distillation scaling law that estimates distilled model performance based on a compute budget and its allocation between the student and teacher. We then used our law to study practical distillation scenarios of interest, and showed that distillation is only more efficient than supervised learning if: i) the total compute or tokens used for distillation is not larger than a student size-dependent threshold, and ii) a teacher already exists, or the teacher to be trained has uses beyond single distillation. Moreover, we use this law to determine optimal distillation scenarios that are able to outperform supervised learning, enabling practitioners to select the best teacher for their use case. This work represents the largest controlled empirical study of distillation we are aware of, with systematic ablations of common distillation techniques. Just as supervised scaling has mitigated risks in supervised pretraining, our findings offer a roadmap for producing smaller, more powerful models with lower inference costs, reducing carbon footprints, and enhancing the feasibility of test-time scaling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impact Statement</head><p>This work shows how to apply the framework of scaling laws to the distillation setting, investigating distillation as a viable alternative to the overtraining paradigm for producing capable language models. The work explains when distillation should and should not be performed, from a compute efficiency perspective, compared to supervised learning. There are a number of benefits to this:</p><p>1. As compute-optimal recipes for distillation are now known, there is greater opportunity for producing powerful models with lower inference costs. Lowering inference costs lower the largest component of language model training carbon footprint.</p><p>2. When combined with other known scaling laws, there is a larger space of models for which we know compute-optimal configurations. To produce models with a given capability, the compute, hardware and climate costs have now been reduced compared to before, as the optimal recipe is known.</p><p>3. Our distillation scaling law lowers compute usage through removing unnecessary experimentation over various hyperparameters and distillation settings. We now understand that the primary driver of student cross-entropy is teacher cross-entropy, and so teacher size and tokens can be discarded as axes to search over.</p><p>4. Small powerful models democratize the study of models with significant capabilities, enabling the involvement of a greater number of perspectives to study model capabilities and safety aspects.</p><p>There are however, potential negative consequences:</p><p>1. Using distillation as part of a training pipeline introduces new sources of bias. Teacher models may contain bias from their pretraining data. Even if a student is distilled on data that is unbiased, the bias of the teacher will be inherited by the student.</p><p>2. Small powerful language models are more efficient during inference, reducing the amount of resources needed for bad actors to achieve their goals, such as generating targeted misinformation at scale.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Limitations</head><p>This work has several limitations that we are aware of:</p><p>• Our work is performed in the language modeling setting only. Although there is good evidence that the functional form of scaling laws applies across domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Henighan et al., 2020)</ref>, we cannot be absolutely certain that distillation behaves in the way we describe in this work in all domains.</p><p>• We perform our analysis on the English subset of C4 dataset (see Appendix I). This means that for our larger token runs, data has been repeated. Although it was shown in <ref type="bibr">Muennighoff et al. (2023b)</ref> that on the C4 dataset, repeating data up to 4 times has negligible impact to loss compared to having unique data, this was shown in the supervised setting, and we cannot be absolutely certain that the same applies in the distillation setting.</p><p>• A second downside of using the C4 dataset is that we are limited in our ability to analyze downstream evaluations of students resulting from distillation. Our performance over standard English language downstream tasks closely follows cross-entropy, however, C4 is not as well suited for pretraining in order to probe aspects like reasoning performance (see Appendix E.1).</p><p>• We focused on distillation as originally defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hinton et al. (2015)</ref>, where the teacher produces a full probability distribution for the student to target. More colloquially, distillation has become used to describe the more general process of using a teacher in order to produce a student. One popular approach for training language models is Sequence-Level Knowledge Distillation <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Kim &amp; Rush, 2016)</ref> where the teacher is sampled, e.g. with beam search, in order to produce sequences for training the student on in a supervised way. This technique, also called synthetic data or hard distillation has been employed to great effect in the LLaMA families <ref type="bibr">(Touvron et al., 2023a)</ref> and most recently, the smaller models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 <ref type="bibr">(DeepSeek-AI et al., 2024)</ref>. While we anticipate that our broader findings also apply in the Sequence-Level Knowledge Distillation, we cannot be absolutely sure. We suggest that verifying the scaling properties of Sequence-Level Knowledge Distillation in a controlled, resource constrained manner as we have done here is important for future study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Extended background</head><p>This section reviews related work on knowledge distillation, capacity gap phenomena, neural scaling laws, and foundation models, highlighting their relevance to our study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.1. Knowledge Distillation</head><p>Bucila <ref type="bibr">et al. (2006)</ref> provided strong evidence that the knowledge gained by a large ensemble of models can be effectively transferred to a single smaller model. Later, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hinton et al. (2015)</ref> introduced knowledge distillation, where a smaller student network learns from a larger teacher network by mimicking its softened output probabilities, improving efficiency and generalization. Building on this, <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Stanton et al. (2021)</ref> studied both fidelity and student generalization, showing that while knowledge distillation often improves generalization, it frequently fails to achieve high fidelity, as student models do not fully match the teacher's predictive distribution. We study fidelity in terms of calibration in Appendix E.8, and show that when the learning signal is consistent with the calibration measure, then the student in our setup is well-calibrated both with respect to the teacher and the actual data. Addressing this, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Beyer et al. (2022)</ref> demonstrated that knowledge distillation is most effective when the teacher is patient and consistent, providing stable targets over prolonged training to improve student generalization and fidelity. Our Language Model (LM) setup automatically satisfies consistency: both the teacher and student see the same data during the student's training. However, our conclusions differ from those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Beyer et al. (2022)</ref> in that although distilling a student for longer does improve its performance, unless the teacher is chosen perfectly, distillation becomes less effective than supervised learning in the patient setting, see Appendix D.2 for a discussion.  <ref type="formula">2024</ref>) and studied in LMs, was further analyzed by <ref type="bibr">Ildiz et al. (2024)</ref>, who extended the theoretical analysis to high-dimensional data and over-parameterized regression. Their findings show that distillation can provably outperform training with strong labels under the same data budget but does not improve the data scaling law. Our distillation scaling law (Equation <ref type="formula">8</ref>) confirms this finding, which for a fixed teacher cross-entropy does not improve the scaling law compared to the supervised one in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>. Moreover, in many previous works, distillation happens with repeated data, that is, the student sees the same data as the teacher does during its training. In our setup, we do not repeat the data between teacher training and distillation, which allows us to examine only the effect of distillation rather than the possible diminishing returns of repeated data; see <ref type="bibr">Muennighoff et al. (2023a)</ref> for more details on the effect of repeating data.</p></div>

More recent works explore scaling laws across different distributions, closely related to knowledge distillation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Hernandez et al. (2021)</ref> derived a scaling law for transfer learning, analyzing effective data transfer in low-data regimes and diminishing returns in high-data regimes. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Barnett (2024)</ref> empirically studied pretraining on one distribution for optimizing downstream performance on another, showing that when the transfer gap is low, pretraining is a cost-effective strategy. Finally, Jain et al. ( <ref type="formula">2024</ref>) theoretically analyze how additional data from a surrogate model affects generalization, demonstrating that surrogate data can reduce test error-even when unrelated-due to Stein's paradox <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Stein, 1956)</ref>, with test error following a scaling law. This setup is related to tuning the coefficient λ in our case, where we also observe a U-shape behavior depending on the teacher and student sizes (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">51a</ref>). However, we are interested in studying the effect of distillation only (λ = 1.0), which differs from their setup. While these works are closely related to knowledge distillation-since one can compare the distribution of the teacher logits to that of the student-they do not establish a distillation scaling law. Moreover, their setup differs from practical knowledge distillation, as it does not involve training a new student model using a teacher but instead studies the effect of transferring training knowledge to a downstream task. Our work is the first to determine and verify a distillation scaling law and examine the regions where one should distill as well as the regions where supervised pretraining outperforms distillation; see Figures 6, 7 and 14 in Appendix D.2 and Section 5.2. Finally, for improving inference cost at a given model capability, the scaling behavior of Mixture of Experts (MoE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Shazeer et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jelassi et al., 2024)</ref> have been investigated in the context of scaling laws <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Clark et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Ludziejewski et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Abnar et al., 2025)</ref> as one alternative to knowledge distillation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B.3. The Knowledge Distillation Capacity Gap</head><p>Despite extensive research on knowledge distillation, a persistent challenge is the curse of capacity gap, where a larger teacher does not necessarily produce a superior student compared to a smaller teacher. This occurs because a large gap in model capacity makes it harder for the student to effectively learn from the teacher's outputs. As a result, there exists an optimal teacher size along the scaling trajectory that maximizes student performance. Our distillation scaling law in Equation 8 confirms this, revealing a u-shaped trend in the scaling law and validating the existence of an optimal teacher. However, our results further indicate that the capacity gap is influenced not only by the size of the teacher but also by its training tokens and, more generally, its loss. A theoretical analysis in the kernel regression setup (Appendix C) supports these findings. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Lukasik et al. (2022)</ref> showed that distillation gains are not uniform and can even degrade performance when small teacher errors are amplified by the student. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Nagarajan et al. (2023)</ref> found that deviations in predictive probabilities cause students to exaggerate the teacher's confidence levels. Several works <ref type="bibr">(Peng et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2023a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Rawat et al., 2024)</ref> observed the capacity gap in pre-training distillation for Large Language Model (LLM)s, affecting both large-to-small and small-to-large distillation. Notably, <ref type="bibr">Zhang et al. (2023a)</ref> proposed an empirical law of the capacity gap, showing that the optimal teacher scale follows an approximately linear relationship with the student's scale. However, our findings suggest that scaling alone is insufficient-one must account for the complexity of the effective hypothesis space (Equation <ref type="formula">8</ref>) and we show that <ref type="bibr">Zhang et al. (2023a)</ref> is a special case of our work when the teachers are compute-optimal from a supervised perspective (see Section 5.3). To address this issue, various strategies have been explored. <ref type="bibr">Yuan et al. (2024)</ref> studied temperature scaling, which simplifies the teacher's output into more learnable representations, aiding student generalization. We analyzed the effect of temperature and learning rate in distillation (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_54">52</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_55">53</ref>) and found that, contrary to existing literature, the optimal temperature is one. We hypothesize that this discrepancy arises because previous studies used repeated tokens, whereas our setup does not involve repeated data. Additionally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Cho &amp; Hariharan (2019)</ref> found that early stopping of the teacher's training mitigates the capacity gap, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Mirzadeh et al. (2020)</ref> proposed progressive distillation, where knowledge is transferred through intermediate models to improve student learning. From a theoretical perspective, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Harutyunyan et al. (2023)</ref> analyzed the capacity gap in distillation using supervision complexity in kernel classifiers. Their findings highlight a trade-off between teacher accuracy, student margin with respect to teacher predictions, and teacher complexity, explaining why some teachers are easier for the student to learn. Earlier, Lopez-Paz et al. ( <ref type="formula">2016</ref>) studied generalization error in distillation, proving that learning from a teacher can be beneficial under certain conditions, particularly when the teacher's capacity is small. Using similar techniques in LMs, <ref type="bibr">Zhang et al. (2023b)</ref> demonstrated that among students of different capacities distilled from the same teacher, smaller students suffer from higher generalization error and lower performance, while larger teachers provide lower generalization error, reinforcing the trade-off in teacher-student capacity. Our distillation scaling law (Equation <ref type="formula">8</ref>) also confirms this trend, and we observe the effect of capacity gap in our scaling law terms, see Section 4.3 for more details.</p><p>Foundation model pretraining Foundation models were initially undertrained <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Brown et al., 2020)</ref>, then followed the compute-optimal scaling law carefully <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hoffmann et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Pearce &amp; Song, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Besiroglu et al., 2024)</ref>, and soon after started overtraining heavily <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Sardana et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bi et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hu et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mesnard et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Jiang et al., 2023)</ref>.

In all these cases, the models are designed to be best possible foundation model that is still cheap and fast to run on lower end hardware. Besides overtraining, more recently, smaller foundation models tend to be distilled from larger models <ref type="bibr">(Gunter et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rivière et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Reid et al., 2024)</ref> to further increase performance. In these cases, the large model either specifically trained with the sole purpose of being a distillation teacher, or an existing model is re-used. In both these cases, there are no reports of how the exact teacher size is decided when taking total compute into account. Determining the optimal allocation of compute budget in the distillation setting is one of the primary contributions of our work (see Section 5.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Teacher Student Capacity Gaps</head><p>In this section, we examine the capacity gap in two settings: kernel regression and a synthetic example using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for a mapping problem. The kernel regression setup provides a theoretical and analytically tractable perspective on the capacity gap. The MLP-based synthetic example allows us to study the capacity gap in a more practical, learnable function approximation scenario. By analyzing these two setups, we aim to better understand the fundamental limitations of distillation when there is a significant mismatch between teacher and student capacities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C.1. Kernel Regression</head><p>One of our main contributions is that the student loss follows a broken power law, where the transition between the two power law regions occur when the student becomes a stronger learner than the teacher (Equation <ref type="formula">8</ref>). This implies that making the teacher too capable (relative to the student) reduces student performance. In this section we show how a capacity gap provably degrades student performance in the setting of kernel regression. While simple, we believe the underlying principle causing the student performance degradation in this case carry over to much more general settings involving neural networks.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proof.</head><p>Let β ⋆ m = {β 1 , ..., β m } denote the coefficients of the optimal teacher g ⋆ m . Note that in the regime m ≥ n, as long as n i=1 β 2 i ≥ D (i.e the norm of the coefficients corresponding to the basis {ϕ 1 , ..., ϕ n } is smaller than D), we have from Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_30">21</ref>that Q(m, k, T, D) = 1, which means that the optimal student doesnt change, hence its error remains constant.

Hence for m ≥ n, we get Therefore, as a function of m, the student error e student (m, n, T, D) first decreases and then increases (for m ≥ n) (for m ≤ n), giving a u-shape in student error due to a capacity gap between the teacher and the student.</p><p>We present an empirical verification of these conclusions in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">10</ref>.

We look at best case distillation in Appendix D.4.3, teacher inference in Appendix D.4.4, teacher pretraining in Appendix D.4.5, and teacher pretraining + inference in Appendix D.4.6. Finally, to aid comparisons across methods, we present the token and parameter configurations for all methods in Appendix D.4.7 and Appendix D.4.8 respectively. For completeness, in the following sections, some of the findings of Section 5.3 are restated.</p></div>

CROSS-ENTROPY</head><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">17</ref> we show the student cross-entropies achieved in the compute optimal case for each scenario in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">5</ref>, and the teacher cross-entropies that enable those student cross-entropies in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">18</ref>.</p><p>Distillation and supervised learning produce the same student at large compute. The first thing to note in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">17</ref> is that at low compute, in the best case and teacher inference scenarios, distillation outperforms supervised learning, consistent with our expectations from distillation and the existing literature (see Appendix B.1). However, once enough the compute is large enough 6 , distillation and supervised learning produce models with the same cross-entropy, i.e. in general, distillation does not allow us to produce better models that supervised learning does, however, distillation does produce better models than supervised learning with modest resources. This behavior is consistent with the asymptotic analysis in Appendix E.6, and can be understood through noting that although distillation modifies the learning process the student undergoes, distillation does not alter the hypothesis space of the student, which is tied to the student size N S , is the same hypothesis space in the supervised and distillation settings, and can be explored in the limit of infinite compute or data.</p><p>2.3 2.4 2.5 Student N S =300M 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 Student N S =500M 2.2 2.4 Student N S =1B 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 Student N S =3B 10 20 10 22 10 24 10 26 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 Student N S =5B 10 20 10 22 10 24 10 26 1.8 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 Student N S =10B 10 20 10 22 10 24 10 26 2.0 2.5 3.0 Student N S =30B 10 20 10 22 10 24 10 26 2.0 2.5 3.0 Student N S =50B Total Compute (FLOPs) Student Cross Entropy L S Distillation (best case) Distillation (teacher inference) Distillation (teacher pretraining + inference) Distillation (teacher pretraining) Supervised The compute at which distillation and supervised learning produce similar models grows with student size. Continuing the previous observation, we see in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">17</ref> that supervised cross-entropy approaches the best case and teacher inference student cross-entropies at a value of compute which increases with compute, meaning that larger students benefit from distillation for larger compute budgets than supervised learning. This implies that if your target student size is small and your compute budget is large, then supervised learning is more likely to be beneficial than if your target student size is larger. The phenomenon happens because larger supervised models saturate in performance at larger values of D (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>), and distillation accelerates progress towards this saturation with the correct choice of teacher (Equation <ref type="formula">8</ref>), with more capable teachers producing more gains per token.</p><p>Including teacher training in compute produces student cross-entropies higher than in the supervised setting. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">17</ref> supervised cross-entropy is always below the teacher pretraining and teacher pretraining + inference scenarios, except at very large compute budgets, when supervised learning and these distillation scenarios produce similar student cross-entropies. This means that if your only aim is to produce the model of a target size with the lowest cross-entropy and you do not have access to a teacher, then you should choose supervised learning, instead of training a teacher and then distilling. Conversely, if the intention is to distill into a family of models, or use the teacher as a server model, distillation may be more computationally beneficial than supervised learning. This finding aligns with expectations, the alternative implies distillation can outperform direct maximum likelihood optimization given fixed compute.</p><p>The optimal teacher cross-entropy decreases with increasing total compute. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">18</ref>, the optimal teacher cross entropy loss has a decreasing trend with respect to the total compute.

In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">25</ref> we see that the M T ≡ D T /N T ratio of the teacher is constant for all values of compute, and can be compared to the ratio in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">19</ref>. This can be understood as there is no inference cost to pay for making the teacher large; we are only minimizing the training compute budgets of two models, and the most efficient way to produce a teacher with a given cross-entropy L T is a teacher that is compute-optimal in a supervised sense. Note that this conclusion is the opposite to the finding in Appendix D.4.4. There, the inference is expensive, and so the teacher should be overtrained. Here, teacher training is expensive, so teacher training should be compute optimal.</p><p>As compute is increased, relatively less should be spent on teacher training, and more on student training.

This happens because, as in all compute scenarios, with increasing compute, the optimal student tokens N * S increases (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">25</ref>). Teacher size and tokens are also increasing with increasing compute, providing a stronger signal for the student with more tokens to learn. However, this increase in teacher size and tokens plateaus, while the student tokens continues to increase. This is because here the teacher is compute optimal, and so the amount of compute needed to improve the learning signal for the student is much less than the amount of compute needed to train the student for to make use of that signal, due to the stronger diminishing returns with respect to D S at a fixed N S (Equation <ref type="formula">8</ref>).</p><p>0 25 50 75 100 Student N S =300M Student N S =500M Student N S =1B Student N S =3B 10 20 10 22 10 24 10 26 0 25 50 75 100 Student N S =5B 10 20 10 22 10 24 10 26 Student N S =10B 10 20 10 22 10 24 10 26 Student N S =30B 10 20 10 22 10 24 10 26 Student N S =50B Total Compute (FLOPs) Optimal Compute Fraction (%) Compute Component Student Training Teacher Logits Teacher Training (</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">)<label>33</label></formula><p>This scenario can be thought of as the compute optimal worst case scenario for distillation, i.e. one teacher is trained only for the purposes of one student.

At low compute, the optimal number of student tokens D * S is not too large, this means there is little penalty to increasing the teacher size, resulting in an approximately supervised compute-optimal teacher given a teacher compute budget. Once the optimal number of student tokens becomes higher than the optimal number of teacher tokens, there is significant penalty to increasing the teacher size. At this point, the teacher solution starts to become the overtrained solution seen in teacher inference, the optimal teacher tokens continue to increase polynomially, but this is not followed with an increase in the teacher size. For sufficiently high compute, corresponding to a large number of student distillation tokens, the compute penalty for teacher size is so large that optimal teacher size decreases with compute.</p><p>10 20 10 22 10 24 10 26 300M 500M 1B 3B 5B 10B 30B 50B L * S 1 .7 0 1 .7 5 1.80 1.8 5 1. 90 1.95 2.00 2.05 2.10 2.15 2.20 2.25 2.30 2.35 2.40 2.45 2.50 2.55 2.602.6 5 2.70 2.75 2.8 0 2.8 5 10 20 10 22 10 24 10 26 L * T 1. 60 1 .6 5 1 .7 0 1.75 1.80 1.85 1.90 1.95 2.00 2.05 2.10 2.15 2.20 2.25 2.30 2.35 2.40 2.45 2.50 2.55 2.60 2.65 10 20 10 22 10 24 10 26 D * S 1B 3B 10B 30B 100 B 300 B 1T 3T 10 T 30 T 10 0T 30 0T 1P 3P 10P 10 20 10 22 10 24 10 26 N * T 500M 1B 1B 2B 3B 5B 10B 2 0 B 30B 50B 1 0 0 B 10 20 10 22 10 24 10 26 D * T 10B 30B 100B 300B 1T 3T 10T 30T 100T Total Compute C Total Student Size N S Figure 27.

In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_24">31</ref> we can see more clearly the interpolation behavior discussed in Appendix D.4.6. At low compute, teacher pretraining and teacher pretraining + inference share optimal solutions because the number of student tokens N * S is small. At high compute, teacher pretraining + inference approaches teacher inference, while teacher pretraining approaches best case, as N * S is large, and costs associated with teacher pretraining become less important. Optimal teacher size interpolate between scenarios based on compute allocation.

As observed in Appendix D.4.2, for all student sizes, if teacher pretraining is included in the computational cost of producing a student, supervised learning is always more efficient than distilling. This can be seen from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">33</ref> as the teacher pretraining (green) and teacher pretraining + inference (red) compute scenarios are above the grey dashed line, which means more compute is needed for distillation than supervised learning in those compute scenarios.

In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">33</ref> we see in the pretrain + inference scenario, producing a N S =500M student with a cross-entropy of 2.4 has roughly 3/4 the compute cost of producing the same model with supervised learning, whereas producing a N S =10B student with a cross-entropy of 2.2 has roughly 1/2 the compute cost of producing the same model with supervised learning. In terms of data (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">34</ref>), the 500M and 10B configurations use roughly 2/3 and 1/2 the number of tokens of their supervised counterparts respectively. The efficiency gains from distillation are potentially greater for larger students when considering compute or data.</p></div>

We cover the models used as teachers, examine the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) between teacher and student in fixed token-tosize ratios, and present supplementary materials to Section 4.1. Additionally, we investigate the limiting behavior of our scaling law, weak-to-strong generalization, and conduct a model calibration study to assess fidelity.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E.2. Teachers used in distillation</head><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_30">36</ref> we show the cross-entropies of the models used as teachers in Section 4.2, and for fitting the supervised scaling law: i) eleven of fixed-M ratio models following the Chinchilla rule of thumb D/N = M * ≈ 20 <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hoffmann et al., 2022)</ref>, ii) six models on D = 512B tokens (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_30">36a</ref>), and iii) four IsoFLOP profiles (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_30">36b</ref>). Together this produces 74 runs corresponding to tuples of (N, D, L).  Coefficient estimation (Appendix F.1) yields the scaling coefficients shown in Table <ref type="table">6</ref>, and a scaling law which has ≲ 1% relative prediction error, including when extrapolated from weaker to stronger models (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5a</ref>). In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">37</ref>, the capacity gap in knowledge distillation can be seen. Improving a teacher's performance does not always improve a student's, and even reduces the performance after a certain point. The KLD between teacher and student is an increasing function of teacher size in all cases, which means as the teacher improves its own performance, the student finds the teacher more challenging to model, which eventually prevents the student from taking advantage of teacher gains. See Appendix E.8.2 for an investigation using calibration to understand where this mismatch occurs.</p></div>

Distillation with infinite data</head><p>From the supervised scaling law (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) a model with N parameters has a cross-entropy lower bound</p><formula xml:id="formula_51">L(N ) ≡ L(N, D = ∞) = E + (AN -α ) γ<label>(35)</label></formula><p>which represents the best solution to the training objective subject to constraints from that model's hypothesis space <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hoffmann et al., 2022)</ref> and is achieved when the number of training tokens is large (D → ∞).

However, it not immediately clear if this is true in practice, since</p><formula xml:id="formula_52">L S (N S ) ≡ L S (N S , D S = ∞, L T = L * T ) (36) = L * T + (A ′ N -α ′ S ) γ ′ (L * T ) c0 1 + L * T d -1 1 L(N S ) 1/f1 -c1f1 ,<label>(37)</label></formula><p>where L * T = arg min L (N S , D S = ∞, L T ) is the teacher cross-entropy that minimizes Equation <ref type="formula">8</ref>. Upon checking numerically, we do find that Equation 35 is consistent with Equation 37 for a range of models N, N S ∈ [100M, 100B] (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_36">40</ref>). We stress that unlike our three motivations for the equation properties (Section 4.3), this infinite data limit was imposed added by hand, and is only true for certain values scaling coefficients. This lower bound consistency is evidence that that our distillation scaling law has desired behavior far outside of observed models, at least along the data and teacher axes. We also note that only the optimal teacher for each student size produces a student cross-entropy lower bound that is consistent with the supervised one. Any other choice produces higher student cross-entropies, either because the teacher is too weak, or due to the capacity gap. For the optimal choice of teacher, the loss achieved by all student sizes under distillation is consistent with the loss achievable by supervised learning. This is not true for any choice of teacher, only the optimal one, which can be determined through numerical optimization of the provided distillation scaling laws (see Section 5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E.7. Weak-to-strong generalization</head><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">41</ref> we see that weak-to-strong generalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Burns et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ildiz et al., 2024)</ref> occurs only in the finite distillation data regime, and when the number of tokens is sufficiently large, the student cross-entropy increases again, eventually matching the teacher cross-entropy. This can be understood in the following way: i) when the student is larger than the teacher, the student contains in its hypothesis space the function represented by the teacher, ii) when the student is shown the teacher outputs on enough of the data manifold, it eventually matches what the teacher does on the whole data manifold. We note this doesn't explain how and why the student outperforms its teacher, and only constrains its asymptotic (low and high distillation data) behaviors. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E.8.2. 198M STUDENTS TRAINED ON 20N TOKENS</head><p>In this section we consider students trained on the teacher distribution, as in our main study. We also study students trained on the teacher top-1 distribution, as described in Appendix G.4, as the qualitative difference in behavior can be informative for student design.</p><p>Evaluating the calibration of a student can be done in a number of ways:</p><p>1. We can compare student outputs relative ground-truth data, as in Appendix E.8.1 for the teachers.</p><p>2. We can compare student outputs with the outputs of its teacher.</p><p>Calibration against ground-truth. First, let's consider comparison against ground truth data. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">43</ref> we show student calibration with respect to the dataset labels for both teacher distribution distillation and teacher top-1 distillation.</p><p>1. Distilled on the full teacher distribution. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">43a</ref>, we observe that the student is well-calibrated against ground truth data. Similar to the teacher's calibration plot in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">42</ref>, we see a small discrepancy at very low and very high confidence values, and the ECE value is low.</p><p>2. Distilled on teacher top-1. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">43b</ref>, we see that a student trained only on its teacher's top-1 prediction, is not calibrated against ground truth data. The blue points below the dashed line indicate an overconfident student, i.e. , its predicted confidence is higher than the actual accuracy in that confidence range. This is because training the student on top-1 assigns the student to the most plausible outcome rather than all the plausible outcomes with correct frequencies. Confidence proportions are low for all bins that are not the most confident bin, and ECE is high, although decreases with increasing teacher size N T .</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">43</ref> shows that training the student on the teacher's distribution results in a calibrated student, whereas training on the teacher top-1 does not. Indeed, optimizing against the teacher's top-1 is not a proper scoring metric, and that teacher top-1 is not an unbiased estimator for the data, while the teacher distribution is.  Calibration against teacher top-1. Next we investigate the first student calibration against the teacher. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_41">44</ref> we show student calibration with respect to the teacher's top-1 label. That is, the next-token label used for accuracy computation, and extract the students confidence is the most probable next-token according to the teacher, instead of the label from data. Here no next token labels are used at all. These teacher top-1 labels are also used for the ECE calculation, which is still computed using Equation <ref type="formula">38</ref>.</p><p>1. Distilled on the full teacher distribution. We see in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_41">44a</ref> that when distilled from the full teacher distribution, the student is not calibrated against the teacher top-1. The blue points are above the dashed line, which means that the empirical accuracy is higher than the model's predicted confidence, i.e. with respect to the teacher top-1, the student is underconfident. This can be understood by noting that the top-1 objective is an easier objective than modeling the full vocabulary at each step.</p><p>2. Distilled on teacher top-1. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_41">44b</ref> we observe that a student is distilled from its teacher's top-1 is calibrated with respect to teacher's top-1.  Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_41">44</ref> shows that training the student on teacher top-1 results in calibration against teacher top-1, whereas a model trained on data, or distilled on the full teacher distribution is not calibrated against teacher top-1. As above, this can be understood as now teacher's top-1 is now a proper scoring metric, and teacher top-1 is an unbiased estimator for itself.</p><p>Calibration against teacher distribution. Here we develop a modified calibration measure that will help us understand if the student matches the teacher in a distributional sense. As we have two distributions to compare, we can ask, for a given teacher confidence, what is the expected student confidence. This leads to ECE Dist , a distributional form of ECE:</p><formula xml:id="formula_53">ECE Dist (A, B) = M m=1 |B m | N Samples |Confidence(B m ; A) -Confidence(B m ; B)| ,<label>(39)</label></formula><p>and is similar in spirit to divergence measures like KLD. B m , |B m |, and N Samples are defined as before, and Confidence S (B m ; A|B) is the average confidence of model A or B in bin m respectively. The bins G m are always witin the bins of confidence of model B. In the current evaluation, we take A as the teacher and B as the student, and we are measuring the average confidence of the teacher is measured within a student's confidence bin.</p><p>1. Distilled on the full teacher distribution. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_43">45a</ref>, we see that when the student is confident, it matches the teacher confidence. However, as the teacher model grows in size, when the student is less confident, it it systematically underestimates its confidence. This suggests that the student has not effectively learned low-probability outcomes, or that these outcomes are particularly challenging for the student to replicate. The underconfidence in these regions may be a result of the distillation process not providing sufficient learning signal for these difficult cases, or the inherent difficulty of capturing the uncertainty associated with low-confidence predictions. This observation of confidence mismatch helps indicate which parts of the distribution the student finds challenging to model, giving rise to the increasing KLD and capacity gap observed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> and Appendix E.3.</p><p>2. Distilled on teacher top-1. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_43">45b</ref>, for small teachers, we observe student overconfidence. As the teacher increases in size, the student's overconfidence in low-confidence bins transitions to underconfidence. At the same time, the student's overconfidence in high-confidence bins improves, leading to an overall reduction in distributional ECE. This pattern of overconfidence in the student is similar to what we saw in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">43b</ref>, but the change in behavior at low-confidence bins as the teacher's size varies is different. This shift in the student's calibration behavior, especially in low-confidence bins, aligns with findings from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_43">45a</ref> and may highlight the difficulty the small student faces in learning rare events.  We can also inspect the student confidences within a bin of teacher confidences, and compute the distributional ECE (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_53">39</ref>), swapping the roles of teacher and student (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_45">46</ref>).</p><p>1. Distilled on the full teacher distribution. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_43">45a</ref> we complete the picture from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_43">45a</ref> and see that the part of the distribution the student struggles to model is actually the place where teacher is most confident.</p><p>2. Distilled on teacher top-1. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_43">45b</ref> we see that the student is systematically overconfident for all values of teaacher confidence, except for the largest teachers, where the student is underconfident when those teachers are most confident.  E.8.3. 198M STUDENTS TRAINED ON 128B TOKENS In this section, we study the effect of increasing the number distillation tokens in Appendix E.8.2 from D S ≈ 20N S to D S ≈ 512B.

Calibration against ground-truth. As the number of distillation tokens increases, we observe a consistent decrease in the ECE when the student is trained on the teacher's distribution, as shown by the comparison between Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_46">47a</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">43a</ref> across different teacher sizes. However, when the student is trained on the teacher's top-1 predictions, increasing the number of tokens negatively impacts ECE, as evidenced by the comparison between Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_46">47b</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">43b</ref>. This suggests that the teacher's top-1 predictions are not a reliable, unbiased estimator of the actual data, and increasing the number of training tokens only exacerbates this issue. See Appendix G.4 for further discussion.</p><p>Calibration against teacher top-1. Increasing the number of distillation tokens leads to worse calibration between the student and the teacher's top-1 predictions when the student is trained on the full distribution. This change primarily occurs in the low-confidence bins, and results in a higher ECE (compare Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_49">48a</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_41">44a</ref>). However, when comparing the ECEs for the student trained on the teacher's top-1 predictions (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_41">44b</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_49">48b</ref>), there is an improvement across all teacher sizes. When the student is trained and evaluated using the same metric, increasing the training tokens helps improve calibration, demonstrating consistency between the learning objective and the evaluation metric.   Calibration against teacher distribution. A comparison between Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_51">49a</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_43">45a</ref> shows that when the student is trained on the teacher's full distribution and evaluated against the full distribution using Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_53">39</ref>, increasing the number of training tokens consistently improves calibration across all teacher sizes. However, when the student is trained on the teacher's top-1 predictions, a quick comparison between Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_51">49b</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_43">45b</ref>   Similarly, when comparing within teacher confidence bins (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_53">50</ref>) increasing the number of distillation tokens from 20N to 128B primarily amplifies the observed phenomena at lower distillation token budgets, and improving calibration in cases where there is a proper scoring metric present (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_53">50a</ref>).  In general, increasing the number of training tokens has a positive effect when the training metric is an unbiased estimator of the actual data or the measured calibration quantities (see Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_49">47a, 48b</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_51">49a</ref>) and reduces the ECE, while it has a negative impact when there is a mismatch between the learned and measured quantities (see Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_49">47b, 48a</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_51">49b</ref>).</p></div>

Temperature (τ ) sensitivity analysis</head><p>In distillation, the temperature τ controls the entropy of teacher predictions by scaling logits z (i)</p><p>T /τ and z (i) S /τ in the knowledge distillation loss L KD (Equations 7 and 53). This scaling modulates the transfer of dark knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Hinton et al., 2015)</ref> -the log-probability ratios between incorrect categories encode the teacher's understanding of relationships between those categories. Our analysis across τ ∈ [0.5, 10] (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_54">52</ref>) reveals that higher temperatures (τ &gt; 3) reduces performance by attenuating these ratios in σ a (z (i) T /τ ), particularly harming smaller students that rely heavily on this signal. Lower temperatures (τ &lt; 1) similarly reduce effectiveness by concentrating probability mass on argmax tokens, diminishing the transfer of relationships between lower-ranked predictions.</p><p>We find optimal performance at τ = 1 across all model scales, suggesting this temperature best preserves log-probability structure. Unlike the original distillation setting, which relied on dark knowledge to represents hierarchical relationships between incorrect classification predictions in the presence of a true label, language modeling is inherently ambiguous and complex, with many valid continuations. It is precisely the understanding of the ambiguity of language we want to transfer to the student, which is supported by our finding that maintaining the teacher's original probability ratios (τ = 1) produces the lowest student cross-entropies. </p></div>

Learning rate (η) sensitivity analysis, verification of µP for distillation</head><p>The peak learning rate η determines the scale of student parameter updates in distillation.

Sweeping values η ∈ [0.001, 0.1] (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_55">53</ref>) reveals that µP achieves optimal performance at η = 0.01 uniformly across all configurations, from 198M to 1.82B parameter students and 546M to 7.75B parameter teachers, consistent with the optimal peak learning rate in the supervised setting.</p><p>Performance varies smoothly and modestly around this optimum, with cross-entropy changing by less than 0.1 nats over one order of magnitude in learning rate. This consistency validates µP's guarantee of scale-invariant training dynamics for distillation, confirming that our experimental setting for determining our distillation scaling law operates at the optimal learning rate or sufficiently close to it in all of our settings. The observed moderate learning sensitivity in distillation partially alleviates the requirement for careful learning rate tuning, showing that in practice the reference learning rate found in the supervised setting can be safely reused in the distillation setting. We investigate how the truncation of the teacher distributions affects student performance. For these methods, when the teacher produces a distribution pT (x (i) = a|x (&lt;i) ), a ∈ {1, . . . , V } over the vocabulary for the student to match, only some entries in the distribution are used. This is done primarily to reduce repeated inference and storage costs in the case teacher outputs are being stored for re-use in the multiple distillations scenario discussed in Section 5.3. In our case, the vocabulary size V = 32168, so assuming storage in float32, means each token requires 32168 × 4 bytes ≈ 129KB, and storing all of C4 (approximately 2T tokens) would take approximately 260 Petabytes, a significant amount of data, roughly the total amount collected during the first ten years of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(CERN, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Given a truncation method M, can a truncated teacher output p(M)</p><p>T can be stored whilst still achieving the gains of distillation? Concretely, the truncation p (M) (x|c) of a distribution p(x|c) with a truncation method M is </p><p>where S M (p( • |c)) represents the set of retained categories (i.e. non-zero probabilities) in the truncated distribution, which then undergoes renormalization over the retained categories.</p><p>We explore two complementary approaches: Top-k and Top-p (nucleus) sampling. As in all of our settings, we evaluate the student cross-entropy against the data distribution with all categories, as this is the model property we are most interested in (a model can trivially match the target distribution if all categories except one are removed). For Top-k, we zero-out all but the largest k probabilities, and Top-p, we zero-out all but the smallest set of probabilities that sum to at least p. </p><p>As the truncation parameters increase (k → V or p → 1), both methods approach the full teacher distribution, and the student's cross-entropy converges to the baseline using the entire pT . Conversely, aggressive truncation (small k or p) induces quantization that preserves only high-probability tokens while discarding information in the tail of the distribution.</p><p>Our empirical analysis (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_57">54</ref>) reveals that both truncation methods directly correlate with reduced evaluation likelihoods. However, this performance degradation can be effectively mitigated through a combination of truncated distributions and ground truth next-token prediction using a mixing coefficient λ ∈ (0, 1) (Equation <ref type="formula">7</ref>). Specifically, with k = 128 and λ = 0.7, we achieve validation losses statistically indistinguishable from those obtained using the complete teacher distribution. For large-scale distillation scenarios where maintaining multiple models in memory is prohibitive, particularly with large teacher models, storing only the Top-k teacher predictions (with λ &gt; 0) enables efficient post-hoc distillation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G.5. Forward and reverse KL divergence</head><p>We investigate both forward (mode spreading) and reverse (mode seeking) Kullback-Leibler divergences for distillation from N T = 1.82B to N S = 546M. The forward KLD D KL (p T ||q S ) (Equation <ref type="formula">7</ref>), minimizes L forward = H(p T , qS ) -H(p T ), where H(p T ) is dropped during optimization as it depends on only fixed teacher parameters. In contrast, the reverse KLD D KL (q S ||p T ) requires explicitly computing the student's entropy, L reverse = H(q S , pT ) -H(q S ).</p><p>The forward KL achieves a lower data cross-entropy compared to the reverse KL (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_28">7</ref>), with an average improvement of 0.28 nats. This suggests that explicitly regularizing with respect to the student's entropy during training may not provide additional benefits for distillation quality. Given both the improved performance and reduced computational overhead of forward KL (which avoids computing student entropy), we recommend using standard forward KL for distillation. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Distillation scaling law applications (additional results)</head><p>In this section, we present results referenced in Section 5. We explore the best-case scenario for distillation under fixed student tokens or compute, as well as under fixed teacher size or compute, while accounting for teacher inference. These results provide further insights into the optimal distillation strategies in different resource-constrained settings. D.1. A contradiction with patient teachers <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Beyer et al. (2022)</ref> showed in computer vision that a good teacher is:</p><p>1. Patient. Distillation works best when training for a large number of epochs, and 2. Consistent. The teacher and the student see the same views of the data under an augmentation policy.</p><p>Our setting automatically satisfies consistency as there is no augmentation policy. There is a remaining question about patience, which in our scenario corresponds to the large D S limit. We observe that for a given student size:</p><p>1. If the teacher is optimally chosen for the student, distilling on a large number of tokens produces the same result as training the model in a supervised way on the same number of tokens (Appendix E.6).</p><p>2. Otherwise supervised learning outperforms distillation (Section 5.3).</p><p>The behavior we observe is expected if solutions a model can access are limited only by function space. Uncertain of the driver behind our conclusion differences, we note the differences between our experimental setups in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>.  <ref type="figure">13a</ref> and <ref type="figure">13b</ref>, when the teacher size, student size, and number of student tokens are held constant, increasing the number of teacher training tokens makes distillation more favorable than supervised learning. This advantage arises because the teacher, with access to more training tokens, can better learn the approximation of the language distribution. As a result, the teacher's learned distribution become more informative for the student to follow, thus improving the student's performance. Note that for a fixed student size and compute, the teacher must be sufficiently large and well-trained; otherwise, supervised learning will outperform distillation. Without adequate teacher size or training, the student may not benefit from the distillation process, leading to inferior performance compared to direct supervised learning.</p><p>We also see that the scatter data matches up well with the contour colors, despite these contour beings a difference of two scaling laws, providing a verification of our setup.</p><p>Supervised learning always outperforms distillation given enough student compute or tokens. The trend observed in Figure <ref type="figure">14</ref> mirrors that of Section 5.1. It demonstrates that, for a fixed teacher size and compute, supervised learning can outperform distillation when the student's compute is sufficiently large. With enough resources allocated to the student, it can learn more effectively from the data directly, making distillation less advantageous in comparison. This advantage only happens at a compute budget that grows with student size.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D.5. Compute and data efficiency gains for distillation compared to supervised learning</head><p>In this final section, we use the compute-optimal strategies developed through Appendices D.4.3 to D.4.6 and understand, for each distillation compute scenario (Table <ref type="table">5</ref>) if it is more compute and/or data efficient to use distillation compared to supervised learning in order to produce a desired model (i.e. of a given size N S with a desired performance, measured in cross-entropy L S ).</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure">33</ref> we show the amount of compute needed to distill a student of a given size to a given cross-entropy as a multiple of the compute that supervised learning needs to produce the same result. We do this for for each of the distillation compute scenarios, whose optimal configurations are given in Appendices D.4.3 to D.4.6. In Figure <ref type="figure">34</ref> we show the same, except we show the number of tokens needed to distill a student of a given size to a given cross-entropy as a multiple of the number of tokens that supervised learning needs to produce the same result. Our distillation token accounting depends on compute scenario:</p><p>i.e. we only count teacher tokens if the teacher pretraining cost is also included in the compute cost (see Equation <ref type="formula">29</ref>). </p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">33</ref>. Compute optimal distillation compute ratios. For eight student sizes, the amount of supervised compute needed to produce a student of the indicated size and cross-entropy. The horizontal dashed line indicates the break-even point, when doing supervised leaning is as computationally efficient as the corresponding distillation compute scenario. Values greater (less) than one indicate distillation is more (less) expensive than supervised learning for producing a model of the indicated size and cross-entropy. The vertical dashed line indicates the lowest cross-entropy achievable by that student.</p><p>When teacher training is discounted, distillation is often more efficient. In Figure <ref type="figure">33</ref>, the base case (blue) and teacher inference (orange) compute scenarios are below the grey dashed line for cross-entropies slightly above the lowest possible cross-entropy (vertical grey dashed line), meaning less compute is needed for distillation than supervised learning. This compute efficiency translates into data efficiency (see Figure <ref type="figure">34</ref>).</p><p>To produce the strongest student possible, supervised learning is more efficient. In Figures <ref type="figure">33</ref> and <ref type="figure">34</ref>, the base case (blue) and teacher inference (orange) compute scenarios attain values larger than one as the target cross-entropy L S approaches the limiting value L(N = N S , D = ∞) for each student size N S , (vertical dashed line). This suggests i) the existence of a more efficient training strategy where distillation is used as an initial training stage, with a transition to Distillation Scaling Laws</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E.8. Model calibration</head><p>Calibration in LMs refers to the alignment between the model's confidence in its predictions and the actual correctness of those predictions. Well-calibrated models provide confidence scores that accurately reflect their probability of correctness, enabling more decision-making. Expected Calibration Error (ECE) is a common metric to quantify miscalibration, and measures the difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy across multiple confidence intervals</p><p>where To measure ECE, we use M = 21 bins uniformly partitioned across the output probability space. Accuracy and confidence are computed in the standard manner: the predicted label is determined via the argmax over the output probabilities for each prediction, and the confidence is defined as the maximum probability assigned to the predicted label. Accuracy is then measured as the proportion of instances where the predicted label matches the ground truth. Notably, this approach focuses solely on the maximum probability prediction, disregarding the calibration of lower-probability predictions. To assess calibration across the entire output distribution rather than just the top prediction, alternative metrics could be considered.</p></div>

For all models, the ECE ranges between 0.4% and 0.6%, suggesting that the models' confidence estimates closely align with their actual accuracies. We also observe that for each plot, the blue points, i.e. , the teacher's actual accuracy for predictions falling into specific confidence intervals, closely follow the diagonal, which shows that the models are well-calibrated. There is a small deviation at low and high confidence values denoted by the orange points. where</p><p>We make no assumptions about the relationships between the values and optimize</p><p>with a Huber δ = 10 -4 , where</p><p>T and L (i)</p><p>S are the student model size, number of training distillation tokens, the teacher pretraining loss and the student validation loss on the data achieved by the i-th run.

For our investigation we are interested in small, capable models, which may have a large context, and so both of these terms cannot be ignored in general at the peril of making a systematic error in the region of configuration space we are most interested in. Fortunately, we will see that our choice of fixed aspect ratio ρ model = d model /n layers architectures allows us a simple to use, more precise estimate. The trick will be to use this fixed aspect ratio to come up with an approximation for n layers and d model as a function of N and ρ model .

	<note>with a final learning rate of one thousandths of the peak learning rate. A Z-loss For all experiments, the English-only subset of the C4 dataset is used for stability, slightly decreasing norm growth at the end of the training is used. The C4 dataset was chosen because of its wide usage in the research community. While C4 is big enough for larger-scale experiments, it is small enough to allow for reproduction of experiments For all distillation trainings, the teacher is trained on a different split as the student. The C4 dataset has roughly 180B tokens in total, which results in 90B unique tokens for the teacher training and 90B unique tokens for the student training Except for the largest models, all Chinchilla-optimal models do not repeat data. Models that overtrain on more than 90B tokens will have data repetition too. Muennighoff et al. (2023b) has shown (on the C4 dataset) that repeating data up to 4 times has negligible impact to loss compared to having unique data. J.
