- **RETREEVER Overview**: A tree-based method for document retrieval that organizes documents at various granular levels, optimizing for retrieval performance without relying on LLM calls.

- **Key Contributions**:
  1. **Coarse-to-Fine Representations**: RETREEVER learns a binary tree structure where each level corresponds to a different representation size, allowing for flexible retrieval based on computational constraints.
  2. **Efficiency and Accuracy**: Achieves high retrieval accuracy with low latency, preserving the accuracy of full representations while providing strong coarse representations.
  3. **Transparency**: The hierarchical structure allows for inspection of the corpus content, revealing semantic groupings and thematic overlaps among documents.

- **Methodology**:
  - **Routing Function**: Each internal node of the binary tree learns a routing function that assigns query and reference documents to similar branches, optimizing for retrieval performance.
  - **Embedding Process**: Reference document snippets are converted into embeddings using encoders like BERT or LongFormer, which are then used to construct the tree.
  - **Inference**: At inference, leaf assignments provide fine representations, while intermediate assignments offer coarse representations.

- **Comparison with Existing Methods**:
  - Unlike traditional hierarchical retrieval methods that rely on LLMs (e.g., MemWalker, Raptor), RETREEVER operates entirely on embeddings, reducing computational costs and improving speed.
  - RETREEVER's approach contrasts with dense retrieval models that require high-dimensional embeddings, which can be costly in terms of memory and computation.

- **Hierarchical Structure**:
  - **Tree Depth**: The tree can be of variable depth (e.g., D = 3), with each level representing different granularity of document representation.
  - **Semantic Grouping**: The tree structure naturally groups documents semantically, aiding in the interpretability of retrieval results.

- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - **Retrieval Accuracy**: RETREEVER is evaluated against various encoding and tree-based methods, demonstrating superior performance in retrieval tasks.
  - **Latency**: The method is designed to minimize latency while maintaining high accuracy, making it suitable for practical applications.

- **Applications**:
  - **Question-Answering Systems**: Enhances the performance of LLMs by grounding generated content in retrieved knowledge, reducing hallucinations.
  - **Corpus Inspection**: Facilitates the inspection of document organization and thematic clusters, aiding researchers and practitioners in understanding retrieval dynamics.

- **Future Work**: Potential improvements could include exploring deeper tree structures or integrating additional semantic features to enhance retrieval performance further.
