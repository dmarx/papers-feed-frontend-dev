  "abstract": "Most real-world datasets consist of a natural hierarchy between classes or an\ninherent label structure that is either already available or can be constructed\ncheaply. However, most existing representation learning methods ignore this\nhierarchy, treating labels as permutation invariant. Recent work [Zeng et al.,\n2022] proposes using this structured information explicitly, but the use of\nEuclidean distance may distort the underlying semantic context [Chen et al.,\n2013]. In this work, motivated by the advantage of hyperbolic spaces in\nmodeling hierarchical relationships, we propose a novel approach HypStructure:\na Hyperbolic Structured regularization approach to accurately embed the label\nhierarchy into the learned representations. HypStructure is a\nsimple-yet-effective regularizer that consists of a hyperbolic tree-based\nrepresentation loss along with a centering loss, and can be combined with any\nstandard task loss to learn hierarchy-informed features. Extensive experiments\non several large-scale vision benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of\nHypStructure in reducing distortion and boosting generalization performance\nespecially under low dimensional scenarios. For a better understanding of\nstructured representation, we perform eigenvalue analysis that links the\nrepresentation geometry to improved Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection\nperformance seen empirically.
