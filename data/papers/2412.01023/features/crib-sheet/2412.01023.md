- **HypStructure Overview**: A hyperbolic structured regularization approach for embedding hierarchical label information in representation learning, enhancing generalization and interpretability.

- **Key Contributions**:
  - Effective in supervised hierarchical classification tasks across multiple vision benchmarks.
  - Enables low-dimensional representations with reduced distortion compared to high-dimensional Euclidean counterparts.
  - Improves Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection without sacrificing In-Distribution (ID) accuracy.

- **Hyperbolic Geometry Advantages**:
  - Models hierarchical relationships with minimal distortion due to negative curvature.
  - Supports embedding tree-like data in finite dimensions effectively.

- **Regularization Term**: 
  - Combines a hyperbolic tree-based representation loss with a centering loss.
  - Can be integrated with standard task losses (e.g., Cross-Entropy, Supervised Contrastive).

- **CPCC (Cophenetic Correlation Coefficient)**:
  - Measures correspondence between tree metrics and dataset distances.
  - Defined as:
    \[
    CPCC(d_T, \rho) = \frac{\sum_{i<j} (d_T(v_i, v_j) - \bar{d_T})(\rho(v_i, v_j) - \bar{\rho})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i<j} (d_T(v_i, v_j) - \bar{d_T})^2} \sqrt{\sum_{i<j} (\rho(v_i, v_j) - \bar{\rho})^2}}
    \]

- **Loss Function**:
  - Composite objective for structured representation learning:
    \[
    L(D) = \sum_{(x,y) \in D} \ell_{Flat}(x, y, \theta, w) - \alpha \cdot CPCC(d_T, \rho)
    \]

- **Hyperbolic Models**:
  - **Poincaré Ball Model**: Main model used for hyperbolic geometry in this work.
  - **Klein Model**: Alternative model with different metric tensor properties.

- **Distance Computation**:
  - Poincaré distance formula:
    \[
    d_B^c(z_1, z_2) = 2 \sqrt{c} \tanh^{-1} \left( \sqrt{c} - (1 + 2c \langle -z_1, z_2 \rangle + c \|z_2\|^2) \frac{z_1 + (1 - c \|z_1\|^2) z_2}{1 - 2c \langle z_1, z_2 \rangle + c^2 \|z_1\|^2 \|z_2\|^2} \right)
    \]

- **Eigenvalue Analysis**:
  - Provides insights into the behavior of structured representations and their impact on OOD detection performance.

- **Experimental Validation**:
  - Extensive experiments demonstrate HypStructure's efficacy in reducing distortion and enhancing generalization, particularly in low-dimensional scenarios.
