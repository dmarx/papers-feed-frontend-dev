<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Bayes' rule naturally allows for inference refinement in a streaming fashion, without the need to recompute posteriors from scratch whenever new data arrives. In principle, Bayesian streaming is straightforward: we update our prior with the available data and use the resulting posterior as a prior when processing the next data chunk. In practice, however, this recipe entails i) approximating an intractable posterior at each time step; and ii) encapsulating results appropriately to allow for posterior propagation. For continuous state spaces, variational inference (VI) is particularly convenient due to its scalability and the tractability of variational posteriors. For discrete state spaces, however, state-of-the-art VI results in analytically intractable approximations that are ill-suited for streaming settings. To enable streaming Bayesian inference over discrete parameter spaces, we propose streaming Bayes GFlowNets (abbreviated as SB-GFlowNets) by leveraging the recently proposed GFlowNets -a powerful class of amortized samplers for discrete compositional objects. Notably, SB-GFlowNet approximates the initial posterior using a standard GFlowNet and subsequently updates it using a tailored procedure that requires only the newly observed data. Our case studies in linear preference learning and phylogenetic inference showcase the effectiveness of SB-GFlowNets in sampling from an unnormalized posterior in a streaming setting. As expected, we also observe that SB-GFlowNets is significantly faster than repeatedly training a GFlowNet from scratch to sample from the full posterior.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>One of the foundations of the Big Data revolution in the sciences and engineering is the use of streaming data that is continuously collected and meant to be processed as it arrives. Many of the large statistical models in use were first formulated for the batched i.i.d. data setting and updating such models in this setting is a challenge of its own, as it would naively require us to revisit all past data at each update to avoid forgetting. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref> In this context, Bayesian inference appears as a natural starting point to learning in the streaming data setting due to its innate property of coherence <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, which allows learning can happen continuously, independently of how the data is chunked into packages or ordered. More specifically, given a prior distribution p(θ) and a data generating likelihood p(y i | θ), the posterior distribution over a set of data p(θ | y 1 , y 2 ) ∝ p(y 2 | θ)p(y 1 | θ)p(θ), can be written as p(y 2 | θ)p(θ | y 1 ), where first we compute the posterior over y 1 and then used as a prior to compute the posterior over y 2 . As conveniently summarized by Lindley <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>: "Today's posterior is tomorrow's prior".</p><p>Nonetheless, Bayesian inference is notoriously known for being hard to obtain closed-form solutions. The gold standard of approximate methods, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), requires that the prior and likelihood distributions probability density/mass functions can be evaluated, however, 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>arXiv:2411.05899v1 [cs.LG] 8 Nov 2024</head><p>as it can only obtain samples from posterior, using the previous posterior as the prior of the next time-step requires additional work <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Thus, variational inference (VI), another popular approximate Bayes method, appears as the best fit as its foundation lies in directly parameterizing the approximate posterior distribution instead of relying on empirical distributions of samples.</p><p>Importantly, many problems of interest are built upon a discrete set of parameters. In Bayesian phylogenetic inference (BPI), for example, we are concerned with topologies of phylogenetic trees describing the evolutionary genetic history of a population. This is a especially compelling application of streaming Bayes, allowing researchers to update posteriors over the phylogenetic trees as they decode new nucleobases in genetic sequences -without reprocessing previously decoded nucleobases. In practice, phylogenetic analyses might involve hundreds of thousands of nucleobases.</p><p>Nonetheless, popular methods for VI over discrete posteriors typically rely on gradient-based optimization (e.g., to maximize evidence lower bounds), requiring the modeling of discrete parameters as transformed versions of latent continuous ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. For methods using VI, a discrete posterior distribution with support over a set of size N would require variational posteriors of dimension N , implying either the storage of large covariance matrices of order N 2 , in the case of continuous reparameterizations, or the use of massively simplifying assumptions such as mean-field, reducing the expressivity of the variational posterior. As an example of support size for discrete distributions, the number of graphs with N nodes grows asymptotically as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">√ 2 N (N -1)</formula><p>/N! <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. In this work, we leverage Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref> to efficiently address the implementation of approximate Bayesian models defined on a discrete set of parameters within a streaming data setting. In summary, GFlowNets are a family of amortized VI methods for highdimensional discrete parameter spaces, that learn the policies of a finite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) by minimizing a loss function enforcing a balance condition. The condition, in turn, provably ensures that the samples generated from the MDP are correctly distributed. Notably, despite their successful deployment in solving a wide range of problems <ref type="bibr">([11, 12, 22-24, 32, 34, 63]</ref>), previous approaches assumed that the target (posterior) distribution did not change in time. Hence, this is the first work handling the training of GFlowNets in dynamic environments.</p><p>More specifically, we propose two novel training schemes to enable GFlowNets on streaming settings. The first consists of directly enforcing a streaming balance condition, which induces a least-squares loss that can be optimized in an off-policy fashion, potentially avoiding issues such as mode collapse. Alternatively, we leverage the well-known relationship between GFlowNets and VI to develop an on-policy divergence-minimizing algorithm that often exhibits faster training convergence when the target distribution is not very sparse. We also analyze theoretically how local errors accumulate through posterior propagation, providing upper bounds on the approximation quality of models learned using both of our update schemes.</p><p>In summary, our main contributions are:</p><p>1. We propose a streaming balance condition and a corresponding provably correct algorithm enabling the training of GFlowNets in a streaming data setting (Algorithm 1), without the need to revisit past data;</p><p>2. We devise an alternative VI algorithm employing low-variance gradient estimators to train to update GFlowNets in streaming fashion (Section 3). ;</p><p>3. We theoretically analyze how inaccuracies of individual updates propagate to subsequent posterior approximations, bounding the approximation errors accumulated through repeated streaming updates of the model (Section 4); 4. We demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of our method in a series of streaming tasks, such as Bayesian linear preference learning with integer-valued features (Section 5.2) and online Bayesian phylogenetic inference (Section 5.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Preliminaries</head><p>Notation and definitions. Let X be a set of compositional objects (e.g., trees with nine nodes) and S ⊇ X be an extension of X (e.g., forests with nine nodes). Define G = (S, A) as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with nodes in S, adjacency matrix A, and the following properties: (i) G is weakly connected; (ii) there is an unique state s o ∈ S \ X without any incoming edges; and (iii) there are no edges leaving x for every x ∈ X . We call S the set of states, G the state graph, and X the set of terminal states; s o is called the initial state. A forward policy over G is a function p F (v, w) : S × S → R + such that it defines a probability distribution over S with support on v's children in G. A backward policy is a forward policy over G ⊺ = (S, A ⊺ ). To alleviate notation, we denote the set of trajectories that ends in x as {τ | τ ⇝ x}, and define a probability distribution in this set as p F (τ ) = i p F (s i , s i+1 ) and the probability of the backwards trajectory condition on the end point x as p B (τ | x) = i p B (s i+1 , s i ).</p><p>GFlowNets. We define a GFlowNet as a tuple G = (G, p F , p B , Z) specifying a state graph G, forward p F and backward p B policies, and an estimate Z of a normalizing constant. A GFlowNet induces a probability distribution over X through its forward policy, p ⊤ (x) := τ ⇝x p F (τ ). When there is no risk of ambiguity, we will generally omit G from this notation. We also drop Z when training the GFlowNet with a criterion that does not require it. Following the common convention, we parameterize the forward network by a neural network, and the backward policy at each state is left fixed as a uniform distribution.</p><p>The task a GFlowNet is trained for is to match its induced distribution p ⊤ (x) with a target distribution π(x) ∝ π(x), where π(x) is an unnormalized distribution. In practice, the agreement between p ⊤ and π can be enforced by a balance condition over trajectories, avoiding references to p ⊤ . For instance, we may enforce trajectory balance (TB) condition, Zp F (τ ) = p B (τ | x)π(x) for all τ ⇝ x, to estimate the parameters of the GFlowNet by minimizing</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">L T B (G) = E τ ∼ξ log Zp F (τ ) p B (τ | x)π(x) 2 , (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>where ξ is a base policy with full support on the space of complete trajectories, i.e., trajectories starting at s o and terminating at s f . Then, we can use the following unbiased estimate to compute the GFlowNet's marginal distribution over terminal states p ⊤ :</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">p ⊤ (x) = E τ ∼p B (•|x) p F (τ ) p B (τ |x) ≈ 1 K 1≤i≤k p F (τ i ) p B (τ i |x) .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>For a thorough review of GFlowNets, please refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>GFlowNets and VI. Malkin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> showed that the training of GFlowNets may be framed as a variational inference on the target p B (τ ) ∝ π(x)p B (τ |x) with p F as the proposal distribution.</p><p>Through the data processing inequality, they showed that the minimization of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between trajectory-level distributions p F and p B incurred in a marginal p ⊤ over X matching the target, namely,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">D KL [p F ||p B ] ≥ D KL [p ⊤ ||π].</formula><p>Then, they demonstrated the equivalence between the gradients of the on-policy TB loss and the KL divergence, and that the latter is a sound learning objective for GFlowNets. Here, we build upon this construction to design a KL divergence-based algorithm for updating GFlowNets in a streaming context.</p><p>Problem description. We assume that the data is drawn from a distribution f (•|x) indexed by a parameter x ∈ X and we define π(x) as a prior distribution over X . Let (D i ) i≥1 be a sequence of continually collected independent data sets and π t (x|D 1 , . . . , D t ) ∝ f (D 1 , . . . , D t |x)π(x) := πt (x) be the posterior conditioned on the first t data sets. Note that, due to coherence, we can also write</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">πt (x) = f (D t |x)π t-1 (x).</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Streaming Bayes GFlowNets</head><p>In this section, we propose streaming Bayes GFlowNets (SB-GFlowNets) as an extension of GFlowNets to handle streaming data. In essence, an SB-GFlowNet G t+1 avoids evaluating πt+1 (x), which would require revisiting all the previous data, by maintaining an SB-GFlowNet G t which targets previous posterior πt (x), allowing the target distribution of G t+1 to be f (D t+1 |x)p</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">(t) ⊺ (x), where p (t)</formula><p>⊺ (x) is the induced distribution of G t , thus avoiding the storage of previous data sets. We propose two strategies for matching the target distribution, enforcing the streaming balance (SB) condition (Section 3.1) and applying KL streaming updates (Section 3.2). Importantly, both methods require only newly observed data D t+1 and the previously trained model, G t to update the posterior approximation, without revisiting past data batches D 1:t . These conditions are extensions of TB condition and KL criterion proposed for the batched data case, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Subsequently, we provide both a theoretical analysis (Section 4) and experimental validation (Section 5) for SB-GFLowNets.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Divergence-based updates of SB-GFlowNets.</head><p>In practice, estimating log Z t by learning is not straight-forward and, if not done properly, may severely damage the quality of the approximation. Divergence-based objectives provide ways to train GFlowNets without relying on estimates of log Z t . Indeed, as we show in our experimental results (Section 5), minimizing a divergence-based objective often leads to a better approximation than conventional approaches. However, unlike TB which allows the use of arbitrary base policies, these approaches normally require the use of p ⊺ (x) as the base policy which may lead to mode collapse depending on target distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</p><p>So, as discussed in Section 2, recall that a GFlowNet may equivalently be interpreted as a hierarchical variational model using p F (τ ) as an approximation to p B (τ ) ∝ π(x)p B (τ |x) allowing GFlowNets to be trained by minimizing any divergence between p F and p B <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Based on this insight, we propose the following divergence-based training criterion for streaming GFlowNets:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Definition 2 (Divergence-based streaming update). Let G t = (G, p (t) F , p (t)</formula><p>B ) be a GFlowNet balanced sampling proportional to πt . For G t+1 = (G, p ) and target distribution π t+1 , define the unnormalized distribution p(τ ) ∝ p </p><formula xml:id="formula_13">L KL (G t+1 ; G t ) = E τ ∼p (t+1) F log p (t+1) F (τ ) p (t) F (τ )f (D t+1 |x) C = D KL p (t+1) F (τ )||p(τ ) ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>is called the KL's streaming criterion.</p><p>Note that when L KL vanishes, p</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">(t+1) F (τ ) ∝ p (t) F (τ )f (D t+1 |x) for all τ ⇝ x and x ∈ X .

To circumvent this issue, we rely upon the REINFORCE leave-one-out (RLOO) gradient estimator <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, which employs a sample-dependent control variate to significantly reduce the noiseness of the estimated gradients.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Theoretical analysis</head><p>While posterior propagation is computationally convenient, preventing training from scratch repeatedly, we should also expect errors to propagate through updates. To better understand the behavior of SB-GFlowNets, we analyze how choosing sub-optimal SB-GFlowNet at time t influences our approximation's quality at time t + 1. We quantify goodness-of-fit of SB-GFlowNets' sampling distribution wrt target both in terms of TV and of their expected distance in log space. Since the SB loss and KL updates incur different parameterizations, we analyze separately the cases in which SB-GFlowNets are trained using each loss.</p><p>Overall, we establish that the accuracy of a SB-GFlowNet's sampling distribution p (t+1) ⊤ at time t + 1 depends on how close the new forward policy p (t+1) F is from being optimal, on the size of the new data chunk D t+1 , and on the goodness-of-fit of the previous estimate p (t) ⊤ . As expected, our analysis suggests that the negative effects of poorly learned p (t) ⊤ are negligible when the size of a data chunk is relatively large. Also, when the previous SB-GFlowNet G t is a poor approximation to the true posterior π t , we discuss the benefits of using an earlier and potentially more accurate checkpoint G s with s &lt; t as a reference for training G t+1 .</p></div>

In this task, X is the space of sets with S elements extracted from a fixed deposit I = {1, . . . , d}.

To define R i , we independently sample f i (d) from an uniform distribution on <ref type="bibr">[-5, 5]</ref>. Correspondingly, we define R</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">(α) i := R 1 /α i</formula><p>as the tempered reward, noting that R (α) i becomes increasingly sparse as α → 0.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> highlights the differences between our two training schemes in terms of the target's temperature. For relatively sparse targets (with α &lt; 1), the benefits of off-policy sampling enacted by the minimization of the TB loss lead to a better performance relatively to the KL-minimizing algorithm. Indeed, the on-policy exploration employed by the latter potentially hinders the model's capabilities of finding the sparsely distributed high-probability regions of the target, slowing down the training convergence and potentially leading to mode collapse <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Also, albeit one could implement an IS estimator for off-policy training under the KL criterion, our early experiments suggested that the increased gradient variance outweighed the gains from enhanced exploration. Ultimately, the choice of an appropriate learning objective for training GFlowNets will depend on the application. For training SB-GFlowNets, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1</ref> shows that both TB and KL minimization result in accurate approximations to the changing posterior.</p></div>

Consider a collection of instances {y i } endowed with a transitive and complete preference relation ⪰; we assume that each y i ∈ {1, 0} d is a binary feature vector. Naturally, the preference relation ⪰ is represented as a mapping u such that y ≻ y ′ if and only if u(y) &gt; u(y ′ ); uncovering u is the major goal of preference learning methods. Similarly to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>, we here assume that u is a linear function, u(y) = x T y, for a integer-valued vector x and that we have access to a data set y = {(y i1 , y i2 , p i )} i denoting whether y i1 is preferred to y i2 (p i = 1) or otherwise (p i = 0) for a fixed individual.

Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2</ref> shows SB-GFlowNet correctly samples form the posterior in a streaming setting. Note, in particular, that the GFlowNet maintains a high distributional accuracy throughout the streaming iterations. Correspondingly, the predictive log-likelihood of a fixed held out data set monotonically increases as a function of the amount of data consumed by the SB-GFlowNet, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>; this behavior, also exhibited by the true posterior <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, emphasizes the similarity between the learned and targeted distributions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Online Bayesian phylogenetic inference</head><p>Problem description. Bayesian phylogenetic inference (BPI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59]</ref> aims to infer structural properties of evolutionary trees given molecular sequences such as DNA and RNA. Formally, let {S 1 , . . . , S N } be a collection of N DNA sequences of size M , S i ∈ {A, T, C, G} M , one for each biological species. We define a phylogeny as a tuple T = (t, b) comprising a rooted tree topology t and its non-negative branch lengths b. In this context, a rooted tree topology is a complete binary tree having N labeled leaves corresponding to the considered species and N -1 unlabeled internal nodes corresponding to their ancestors. To carry out Bayesian inference over the space of phylogenies, we adopt Jukes &amp; Cantor's nucleotide substitution model (JC69; <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>) to define a observational model over the observed DNA sequences; to calculate the likelihood, we use Felsenstein's algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>Crucially, despite the popularity of BPI methods, the development of new sequencing technologies has swiftly led to the enlargement of already sizeable sequence databases. In this scenario, maintaining an up-to-date estimate of the posterior became an increasingly difficult task due to the necessity of re-estimating the full posterior from scratch every time a new batch of data is collected. In the following, we show that GFlowNets, which have recently shown SOTA performance in BPI <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, can also accurately update the posterior on phylogenetic trees given additional sequences.</p><p>Experimental setup. We generate the data by simulating JC69's model for a collection of N = 7 species and a substitution rate of λ = 5•10 -1 (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>, Chapter 1). At each iteration, we sample a new DNA subsequence of size 10 2 for each species and update SB-GFlowNet according to Algorithm 1. For Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, |D 1 | = 10 3 and |D 2 | = 10 2 . The prior is an uniform distibution over phylogenies.  Results. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> (left) shows that the learned posterior distribution gets increasingly concentrated on the true phylogenetic tree; this behavior, which is inherent to posteriors over phylogenies under uniform priors <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, emphasizes the similarity between the learned and targeted distributions for SB-GFlowNets. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> (right), on the other hand, also suggets that the model's accuracy decreases as a function of the number of streaming updates. Nonetheless, we believe that this is predominantly caused by the posterior's increasing sparsity due to the expanding data sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, which makes it more difficult for the GFlowNet to learn a good approximation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, instead of by an intrinsic limitation of SB-GFlowNets. An investigation of this phenomenon and of the conditions upon which re-train the SB-GFlowNet based on an earlier checkpoint due to the accumulated unreliability of the streaming updates, as described by Proposition 4, is left application-dependent and is thereby left to future endeavors. Finally, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows that SB-GFlowNets, which avoids evaluating the full posterior, more than halve the training time required by a standard GFlowNet, while achieving a similar performance in terms of the total variation (T V ) distance between the learned and target distributions. In this case, the linear Gaussian SEM represents a Bayesian network, and it is the goal of Bayesian structure learning algorithms to find such a network based on the observed X <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Although this problem has been studied beyond the constraints of linear models governed by Gaussian distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, we focus on a simplified setting in this section. In particular, given a sequence {X t } t≥1 of i.i.d. realizations of a linear Gaussian SEM, we define a belief distribution over Bayesian networks N = ({1, . . . , d}, A) on variables {1, . . . , d} and adjacency matrix A as</p></div>

SB-GFlowNets can naturally handle streaming inference for this model by casting each R t as a subposterior distribution -in the same fashion of the set generation task in Section 5.1. Results. Our results corroborate the findings of Section 5.3. On the one hand, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">5</ref> highlights that our SB-GFlowNet can accurately learn a distribution over DAGs across a range of streaming updates.

Recently, there is an increasing literature concerned with the possibility of composing multiple pre-trained GFlowNets to fit them to specific applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and to accelerate training convergence <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. In this context, we show how the composition of two GFlowNets through the SB condition leads to an efficient learning algorithm for Bayesian inference under a streaming setting.</p><p>Streaming Variational Bayes. Streaming, Distributed, Asynchronous (SDA) Bayes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> was originally presented as a general framework for implementing variational inference algorithms in a streaming setting. Similarly to our work, it was based upon the principle that, if the variational distribution q (t) (x) is a good approximation to the unnormalized posterior πt (x), then q (t+1) (x) may be optimized to approximate q (t) (x)f (D t |x) instead of f (D t |x)π t (x). This framework was instantiated to accommodate, for example, the learning of Gaussian processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, of tensor factorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, of feature models <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> and, jointly with SMC, nonlinear state-space models <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. Nonetheless, our work is the first one to enable the training of GFlowNets in a streaming setting and, due to the relationship between GFlowNets and variational inference algorithms presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, may be viewed as an instance of SDA-Bayes tailored to inferential problems on a combinatorial support. In the realm of approximate Bayesian inference, Akhound-Sadegh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, Berner et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, Sendera et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, Zhang and Matsen <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> propose advancements in diffusion-based sampling methods, which we believe could be extended to the context of approximate streaming Bayesian inference via the techniques presented in this work. On the other hand, Mittal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> introduces an neural network-based approach for approximate Bayesian inference that amortizes over exchangeable data sets to handle posterior inference in novel data. Also, Richter and Berner <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, Richter et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> develop a low-variance gradient estimator for carrying out variational inference derived from the log-variance loss, which could be employed as an alternative to our KL-based objective for streaming updates of GFlowNets.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusions, limitations, and outlook</head><p>Conclusions. We proposed the first method for carrying out approximate Bayesian inference over discrete distributions within a streaming setting, called SB-GFlowNet. We proposed two training/update schemes for SB-GFlowNet, as well as a theoretical analysis accounting for the compounding effect of errors due to posterior propagation. Our experimental evaluation showcases SB-GFlowNet's effectiveness in accurately sampling from the target posterior -while still achieving a significant reduction in training time relative to standard GFlowNets.</p><p>Limitations. Proposition 2 and Proposition 4 suggest that an inappropriate approximation to π t may be propagated through time and lead to increasingly inaccurate models. This phenomenon, known as catasthropic forgetting in the online literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>, may eventually demand retraining of the current SB-GFlowNet based on an earlier checkpoint or on the full posterior. We also note that unlike traditional variational methods, where the expressiveness of the approximation family is explicitly chosen, the expressiveness implied by different parametrizations of GFlowNets is not clear. We believe this is a fruitful avenue for future investigation.</p><p>Outlook and future works As our proposal provides generic and efficient streaming variational inference solution for discrete parameters, we believe it will allow the use of streaming discrete Bayesian inference to more datasets and to less explored research domains. In this work, we proposed two training criteria based on the trajectory balance condition and the KL criterion, nonetheless, these are not the only training schemes for GFlowNets, we believe other proposed criteria such as detailed balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> or the sub-trajectory balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> could be adapted for the streaming setting as well. Additionally, due to the flexibility of GFlowNets in sampling unnormalized distributions, our proposal can be extended to different divergences and generalized likelihoods to improve the predictive quality of the learned posteriors <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Finally, the problem of updating a GFlowNet when the size of the generated object changes, e.g., when a new species is observed during BPI, remains open.</p></div>

The forward policy is parameterized as a two-layer neural network and the backward policy is fixed as an uniform distribution.</p><p>C.2 Linear preference learning with integer-valued features Experimental setup. We assume that x ∈ [[0, 4]] d and d = 24 and that the data was simulated from the observational model. At each streaming round, a novel and independent data set was simulated and the model was trained by minimizing the SB loss. To parameterize the forward policy, we implemented an MLP with 2 64-dimensional layers receiving the padded parameter x as an input and returning a probability distribution over <ref type="bibr">[[0, 4]</ref>].</p><p>GFlowNet's design. The generative process implemented by the GFlowNet consists of, starting at an initially empty state x o , iteratively sampling a value from <ref type="bibr">[[0, 10]</ref>] and appending this value to the current state until its length reaches d. To parameterize the forward policy, we use an MLP with two 64-dimensional layers that receives the padded state as a fixed-size input.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C.3 Online Bayesian phylogenetic inference</head><p>Experimental setup. We assume the observational data follow the J&amp;C69 mutation model with an instantaneous mutation rate of λ = 5 • 10 -3 . The data was synthetically generated from the corresponding observational model conditioned on a randomly sampled tree with 7 leaves, and this process was repeated at each streaming round. To illustrate the computational gains enacted by the implementation of SB-GFlowNets in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, we considered updating a GFlowNet trained on an initially large data set according to the newly observed and relatively small biological sequences, which is a common challenge faced by practitioners. Then, by avoiding the additional log-likelihood evaluations, we achieved significantly faster inference.</p><p>GFlowNet's design. A state consists of a forest of complete binary trees. Initially, all leaves are roots of their own singleton trees and, at each iteration of the generative process, we select two trees and join their roots to a newly added unlabelled node. This procedure is finished when all leaves are connected; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63,</ref><ref type="bibr">Figure 1]</ref> for an illustration of this generative process. To parameterize p F , we use a graph isomorphism network (GIN; <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>); the backward policy is fixed as uniform.</p><p>C.4 Bayesian structure learning Experimental setup. We sample each component of the error terms ϵ from a zero-centered Gaussian distribution with standard deviation σ = 5 • 10 -2 . Also, we select a random Bayesian network from a directed configuration model <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> and draw the components β from a corresponding standard Gaussian distribution to define the true data-generating process. To parameterize the policy network, we use an MLP with 2 128-dimensional layers receiving the DAG's flattened adjacency matrix as input.</p><p>GFlowNet's design. We adopt Deleu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>'s DAG-GFlowNet. In a nutshell, the generative process starts at an edgeless graph and each transition either adds an edge to the current state or triggers a stop. To ensure the acyclicity of the generated samples, we follow <ref type="bibr">[11,</ref> Appendix C] and iteratively update a binary vector m ∈ {1, 0} d×d indicating which edges in the adjacency matrix can be safely added to the current state without forming cycles.  Exchangeability is a natural property of each case study we presented in the main text. We thus ask: are SB-GFlowNets permutation invariant? Clearly, the distribution learned by a SB-GFlowNet does not depend on the order in which the data sets are observed when the SB condition is satisfied at each streaming update; this is a direct consequence of Proposition 1. On the other hand, permutation invariance is not guaranteed when the learning objectives are only imperfectly minimized; see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">8</ref> for an extreme example. To the best of our knowledge, however, this sensibility to data ordering is a property of every approximate streaming Bayesian inference method, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</p></div>

The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.</p><p>• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.</p><p>• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.</p><p>• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.</p><p>• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.</p><p>• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.</p><p>Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?</p><p>Answer: [Yes] Justification: In general, plots count on error bars and tables count on standard deviation.</p><p>Guidelines:</p><p>• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.</p><p>• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.</p><p>• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).</p><p>• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)</p><p>• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).</p><p>• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.</p><p>• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.</p><p>• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).</p><p>• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.</p></div>

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.</p><p>• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.</p><p>• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).</p></div>

At each update, an additional dataset of 200 points was sampled from the true model. For this problem, we implemented a DAG-GFlowNet on 5-variable data sets, similarly to [11, Figure 3].Problem description. Let X ∈ R n×d be a data set distributed according to a linear Gaussian structural equation model (SEM), i.e., X = βX + ϵ, in which β ∈ R d×d is a (sparse) matrix and ϵ ∈ R n×d are nd i.i.d. samples from a normal distribution. We assume that the adjacency matrix induced by β, [β ̸ = 0] ∈ {1, 0} d×d , characterizes a directed acyclic graph on the dataset's variables. In this case, the linear Gaussian SEM represents a Bayesian network, and it is the goal of Bayesian structure learning algorithms to find such a network based on the observed X<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Although this problem has been studied beyond the constraints of linear models governed by Gaussian distributions<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, we focus on a simplified setting in this section. In particular, given a sequence {X t } t≥1 of i.i.d. realizations of a linear Gaussian SEM, we define a belief distribution over Bayesian networks N = ({1, . . . , d}, A) on variables {1, . . . , d} and adjacency matrix A as</figDesc></figure>
