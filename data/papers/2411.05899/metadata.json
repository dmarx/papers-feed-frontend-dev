  "abstract": "Bayes' rule naturally allows for inference refinement in a streaming fashion,\nwithout the need to recompute posteriors from scratch whenever new data\narrives. In principle, Bayesian streaming is straightforward: we update our\nprior with the available data and use the resulting posterior as a prior when\nprocessing the next data chunk. In practice, however, this recipe entails i)\napproximating an intractable posterior at each time step; and ii) encapsulating\nresults appropriately to allow for posterior propagation. For continuous state\nspaces, variational inference (VI) is particularly convenient due to its\nscalability and the tractability of variational posteriors. For discrete state\nspaces, however, state-of-the-art VI results in analytically intractable\napproximations that are ill-suited for streaming settings. To enable streaming\nBayesian inference over discrete parameter spaces, we propose streaming Bayes\nGFlowNets (abbreviated as SB-GFlowNets) by leveraging the recently proposed\nGFlowNets -- a powerful class of amortized samplers for discrete compositional\nobjects. Notably, SB-GFlowNet approximates the initial posterior using a\nstandard GFlowNet and subsequently updates it using a tailored procedure that\nrequires only the newly observed data. Our case studies in linear preference\nlearning and phylogenetic inference showcase the effectiveness of SB-GFlowNets\nin sampling from an unnormalized posterior in a streaming setting. As expected,\nwe also observe that SB-GFlowNets is significantly faster than repeatedly\ntraining a GFlowNet from scratch to sample from the full posterior.",
