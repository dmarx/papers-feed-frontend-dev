### Detailed Technical Explanations and Justifications for ESPACE

#### 1. **ESPACE Overview**
The Eigen Static Principal Activation Component Estimation (ESPACE) technique is designed to compress large language models (LLMs) by focusing on the dimensionality reduction of activations rather than weights. This approach is motivated by the observation that activations, which are generated dynamically during inference, often contain redundancies that can be exploited for compression. By projecting these activations onto a static set of principal components, ESPACE maintains the integrity of the weight matrices, allowing for effective model compression without sacrificing expressivity.

#### 2. **Key Contributions**
- **Static Projection onto Orthonormal Matrix**: The decision to project activation tensors onto a pre-calibrated orthonormal matrix \( P \) is crucial. This static nature of \( P \) ensures that the weights remain intact and fully trainable, which is essential for maintaining model expressivity during retraining. The orthonormal property of \( P \) (i.e., \( P^T P = I \)) guarantees that the projection preserves the geometric structure of the activations, minimizing information loss.

- **Matrix Multiplication Associativity**: The use of matrix multiplication associativity allows for the decomposition of weight matrices as a byproduct of the activation projection. This means that during inference, the model can leverage the pre-computed product \( P^T W \) to achieve compression without needing to alter the original weight matrices. This is a significant advantage over traditional weight-centric methods, which often require retraining and can lead to a loss of expressivity.

- **Theoretical Derivation of Optimal Projection Matrices**: The theoretical foundation of ESPACE is built on deriving optimal projection matrices that minimize mean squared error and forward propagated noise. This is achieved through eigenvalue decomposition of activation auto-correlation, which identifies the most informative components of the activations. By focusing on these components, ESPACE effectively reduces dimensionality while preserving the essential characteristics of the activations.

#### 3. **Compression Performance**
- **Achieving ~50% Compression**: The empirical results demonstrating a ~50% compression rate on models like GPT-3, Llama2, and Nemotron4 with minimal accuracy loss (e.g., a 0.18 increase in perplexity) validate the effectiveness of the ESPACE approach. This performance is particularly noteworthy given the scale of these models, where maintaining accuracy while reducing size is a significant challenge.

- **Performance Improvement at Lower Compression Rates**: The ability of ESPACE to improve model performance at lower compression rates (20%-40%) is a key finding. The observed decrease in perplexity (e.g., 0.38 for GPT-3-8B) suggests that the method not only compresses the model but also enhances its ability to generalize, likely by filtering out noise and focusing on the most relevant features of the data.

#### 4. **Latency Reduction**
- **GEMM Execution Time and Prefill Inference Latency**: The reduction in General Matrix Multiply (GEMM) execution time and prefill inference latency by 35%-45% is a significant advantage of ESPACE. This improvement translates to a faster time to first token, which is critical for real-time applications. The efficiency gains are attributed to the reduced number of operations required during inference due to the lower dimensionality of the activation tensors.

#### 5. **Matrix Multiplication Notation**
- The notation \( Y = W^T X \) succinctly captures the relationship between weights and activations. The dimensions of the matrices are carefully chosen to reflect the architecture of LLMs, where \( K \) represents the hidden size, \( N \) the output size, and \( M \) the batch size. This clarity in notation aids in understanding the subsequent transformations and approximations introduced by ESPACE.

#### 6. **Activation Projection**
- The approximation \( Y \approx W^T P P^T X \) highlights the core mechanism of ESPACE. By introducing the projection matrix \( P \), the method effectively reduces the dimensionality of the input activations while allowing for the reconstruction of the output through the associativity of matrix multiplication. This approach minimizes the computational burden during inference while maintaining the fidelity of the output.

#### 7. **Training and Inference**
- The distinction between training and inference phases is critical. During training, the weights \( W^T \) are trainable while \( P \) remains static, allowing for effective learning without compromising the model's expressivity. In contrast, during inference, the reliance on pre-computed matrices \( P \) and \( P^T W \) ensures that the model operates efficiently without the need for real-time computation of the projection.

#### 8. **Comparison with Existing Techniques**
- ESPACE's focus on activation decomposition sets it apart from traditional weight-centric tensor decomposition methods. By addressing the limitations of prior methods, such as the loss of expressivity during retraining, ESPACE offers a novel
