  "abstract": "We propose a robust and computationally efficient algorithm to generically\nconstruct first return maps of dynamical systems from time series without the\nneed for embedding. Typically, a first return map is constructed using a\nheuristic convenience (maxima or zero-crossings of the time series, for\nexample) or a computationally delicate geometric approach (explicitly\nconstructing a Poincar\\'e section from a hyper-surface normal to the flow and\nthen interpolating to determine intersections with trajectories). Our approach\nrelies on ordinal partitions of the time series and builds the first return map\nfrom successive intersections with particular ordinal sequences. Generically,\nwe can obtain distinct first return maps for each ordinal sequence. We define\nentropy-based measures to guide our selection of the ordinal sequence for a\n``good'' first return map and show that this method can robustly be applied to\ntime series from classical chaotic systems to extract the underlying first\nreturn map dynamics. The results are shown on several well-known dynamical\nsystems (Lorenz, R{\\\"o}ssler and Mackey-Glass in chaotic regimes).",
