## Detailed Technical Explanations and Justifications

### First Return Map (FRM)

The First Return Map (FRM) is a powerful tool in the analysis of dynamical systems, particularly in understanding the behavior of chaotic systems. The decision to utilize FRMs stems from their ability to simplify complex dynamics by projecting continuous systems onto lower-dimensional maps. This reduction in dimensionality allows researchers to focus on the essential features of the system without being overwhelmed by the intricacies of higher-dimensional dynamics. The FRM connects points of an orbit as it first returns to a Poincaré section, effectively capturing the system's behavior in a more manageable form. This approach is particularly useful in chaotic systems where traditional methods may struggle to provide clear insights.

### Poincaré Section

The Poincaré section serves as a critical component in the construction of the FRM. By defining an n-1 dimensional surface that is transverse to the flow of the dynamical system, researchers can identify the points where orbits intersect this surface. The rationale for using Poincaré sections lies in their ability to reduce the complexity of the system's dynamics. By focusing on these intersections, researchers can analyze the system's behavior in a discrete manner, allowing for the identification of periodic and quasiperiodic orbits. This method is particularly advantageous when dealing with systems where the full state space is not easily accessible.

### Ordinal Partition Networks (OPN)

The introduction of Ordinal Partition Networks (OPN) represents a significant advancement in the analysis of time series data. By sliding a window of length \( L \) over the data, OPN captures the relative order of points within each window, transforming the time series into a network representation. This approach allows researchers to analyze the dynamics of the system without the need for complex numerical models or full access to the attractor. The decision to use OPN is justified by its ability to provide a robust and computationally efficient means of reconstructing the FRM from scalar time series data.

### Window Parameters

The choice of window parameters—window length \( L \), number of points \( m \), time gap \( \tau \), and non-overlapping points \( w \)—is crucial for the effectiveness of the OPN method. 

- **Window Length \( L \)**: This parameter determines the range of data points analyzed in each window. A well-chosen \( L \) ensures that the window captures sufficient dynamics without being too large, which could obscure finer details.
  
- **Number of Points \( m \)**: The number of points in each window directly influences the complexity of the resulting network. More points allow for a richer representation of the dynamics but may also introduce noise if not carefully managed.

- **Time Gap \( \tau \)**: The time gap between points in the window is essential for maintaining the temporal structure of the data. The relationship \( L = (m-1)\tau \) ensures that the window is appropriately sized for the number of points being analyzed.

- **Non-overlapping Points \( w \)**: The choice of \( w \) affects the number of windows generated from the time series. A smaller \( w \) increases the number of windows, providing more data points for analysis, while a larger \( w \) may lead to a more generalized view of the dynamics.

### Ranking Methods

The use of ranking methods, such as amplitude ranking and chronological index ranking, is justified by their ability to capture the essential features of the time series. 

- **Amplitude Ranking**: This method ranks points based on their amplitude, allowing for the identification of significant peaks and troughs in the data. This is particularly useful in systems where amplitude variations are indicative of underlying dynamics.

- **Chronological Index Ranking**: By ranking points based on their time index, this method preserves the temporal order of events, which is crucial for understanding the evolution of the system over time. The decision to use chronological index ranking in this study enhances the fidelity of the OPN representation.

### Entropy-based Measures

Entropy-based measures are employed to evaluate and select ordinal sequences that yield "good" first return maps. The rationale behind this choice is that entropy provides a quantitative measure of the complexity and unpredictability of the dynamics. By selecting ordinal sequences with higher entropy, researchers can ensure that the resulting FRM captures the essential features of the system's dynamics, enhancing the robustness of the reconstruction.

### Noise Resistance

The ordinal-based approach is inherently robust against noise, making it particularly suitable for real-world data that often contains significant noise contamination. This noise resistance is a critical advantage, as it allows researchers to extract meaningful insights from data that may otherwise be obscured by random fluctuations. The decision to focus on ordinal partitions, which are less sensitive to noise than raw data, underscores the practicality of this method in applied settings.

### Application to Chaotic Systems

The validation of the method on well-known chaotic systems such as Lorenz, Rössler, and Mackey-Glass demonstrates its effectiveness in reconstructing first return maps. This application is justified by the
