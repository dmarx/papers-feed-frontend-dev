### Detailed Technical Explanations and Justifications

1. **Decision on the Algorithm for Constructing First Return Maps (FRMs)**:
   The choice of an algorithm that utilizes ordinal partitions for constructing FRMs is motivated by the need for a robust and computationally efficient method. Traditional methods often rely on geometric approaches or heuristics that can be sensitive to noise and require careful selection of parameters. By leveraging ordinal partitions, the proposed method captures the essential dynamics of the system while being less sensitive to noise, as it focuses on the order of values rather than their exact magnitudes.

2. **Choice of Ordinal Partitions as a Method for Time Series Analysis**:
   Ordinal partitions provide a way to reduce the complexity of time series data by transforming continuous values into discrete ordinal ranks. This transformation allows for the extraction of dynamical features without the need for full phase space reconstruction, making it particularly useful for analyzing real-world data that may be noisy or incomplete. The ordinal approach also facilitates the identification of patterns and transitions in the data, which are crucial for understanding the underlying dynamics.

3. **Selection of Entropy-Based Measures for Ordinal Sequence Evaluation**:
   Entropy-based measures are chosen because they provide a quantitative way to assess the complexity and unpredictability of ordinal sequences. By evaluating the entropy of different ordinal partitions, researchers can identify which partitions yield the most informative and representative FRMs. This approach aligns with the goal of maximizing the dynamical information extracted from the time series while minimizing redundancy.

4. **Use of Chronological Index Ranking for Ordinal Partitioning**:
   Chronological index ranking is preferred over amplitude ranking because it preserves the temporal order of the data points, which is critical for capturing the dynamics of the system. This method ensures that the ordinal representation reflects the sequence of events in the time series, allowing for a more accurate reconstruction of the underlying dynamics.

5. **Determination of Window Length (L) for OPN Generation**:
   The window length (L) is a crucial parameter that influences the granularity of the analysis. A longer window may capture more global features of the dynamics, while a shorter window may reveal local behaviors. The choice of L is guided by the need to balance these aspects, ensuring that the resulting OPN is representative of the system's dynamics without being overly sensitive to noise or fluctuations.

6. **Decision on the Number of Points (m) in Each Window for Analysis**:
   The number of points (m) in each window is selected to ensure that there is enough data to capture the dynamics while maintaining computational efficiency. A larger m increases the complexity of the resulting network but may also introduce noise. The choice of m is thus a trade-off between detail and robustness, with considerations for the specific characteristics of the time series being analyzed.

7. **Choice of Non-Overlapping Points (w) Between Windows**:
   The decision to use non-overlapping points (w) is based on the desire to maximize the number of windows analyzed while maintaining a coherent representation of the dynamics. By allowing for overlap (w=1), the method can capture more transitions and changes in the ordinal sequences, leading to a richer representation of the underlying dynamics.

8. **Approach to Handling Noise in Time Series Data**:
   The ordinal partitioning method is inherently robust to noise, as it focuses on the order of values rather than their magnitudes. This characteristic allows the method to extract meaningful dynamics even in the presence of significant noise, making it suitable for real-world applications where data quality may be compromised.

9. **Selection of Dynamical Systems for Validation (Lorenz, Rössler, Mackey-Glass)**:
   The choice of well-known chaotic systems like Lorenz, Rössler, and Mackey-Glass for validation is strategic. These systems exhibit rich dynamical behaviors and are widely studied, providing a benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed method. By applying the method to these systems, researchers can demonstrate its applicability across different types of chaotic dynamics.

10. **Method for Comparing FRMs from Different Ordinal Partitions**:
    The comparison of FRMs generated from different ordinal partitions is facilitated by the use of entropy measures and statistical techniques. This approach allows researchers to quantify the differences in the dynamical information captured by each partition, enabling a systematic evaluation of their effectiveness in reconstructing the underlying dynamics.

11. **Decision to Avoid Traditional Embedding Techniques**:
    The avoidance of traditional embedding techniques is based on their limitations, such as the difficulty in selecting appropriate parameters (dimension and lag) and their sensitivity to noise. By using ordinal partitions, the proposed method circumvents these challenges, providing a more straightforward and robust approach to analyzing time series data.

12. **Choice of Using a Complex Network Representation for Time Series**:
    The complex network representation is chosen because it allows for the visualization and analysis of the relationships between different states in the time series. This representation facilitates the application of network analysis tools, enabling researchers to extract features and identify patterns that may not be apparent in the raw time series data.
