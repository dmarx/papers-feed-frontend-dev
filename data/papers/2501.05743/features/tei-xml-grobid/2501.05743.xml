<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Scattering amplitudes are key quantities in Quantum Field Theory (QFT), and a crucial ingredient for precision prediction in contexts ranging from collider physics to gravitational-wave observations. In the study of scattering amplitudes, a prominent role is played by planar maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (planar N = 4 SYM theory); see e.g. Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> for a review. Although it is not a realistic theory of nature, its simplicity has made it an ideal testing ground for developing techniques that are later applied to realistic theories such as quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Moreover, planar N = 4 SYM theory provides the opportunity to study properties of scattering amplitudes at very high loop orders, and even a chance of obtaining results at any loop order.</p><p>Probably the simplest non-trivial scattering amplitude in planar N = 4 SYM theory is the three-gluon form factor of the operator tr(F 2 + ), where tr is a color trace and F + is the self-dual part of the field strength; see figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. This form factor is the analog of the Higgs-to-three-gluon amplitude in QCD in the limit of a large top quark mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Moreover, via the so-called antipodal duality, it is related to the (maximally helicity violating) six-gluon amplitude in planar N = 4 SYM theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>The infrared-finite part of the three-gluon form factor, F , depends on only two dimensionless variables. It is conjectured to be expressible in terms of two-dimensional harmonic polylogarithms (2dHPLs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> at any loop order <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</p><p>Integrability (see Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> for a review) in the form of the form factor operator product expansion (FFOPE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> has given us an all-loop understanding of this form factor in an expansion around the collinear limit p 1 || p 2 . The symbol bootstrap program <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> is complementary to the FFOPE; see Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> for a review. It allows one to obtain perturbative results -so far up to eight-loop order <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> -based on the symbol <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, which is part of the Hopf algebra of multiple polylogarithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The symbol of the three-gluon form factor at L loops is given by a sum of words, i.e. sequences of 2L letters drawn from the alphabet {a, b, c, d, e, f }, multiplied by associated integer coefficients. The letters {a, b, c, d, e, f } are simple functions of the dimensionless kinematical variables u, v, w, defined in eq. (2.4) below.</p><p>In the symbol bootstrap program, the coefficients of the words are determined one loop order at a time via large systems of linear equations. These linear equations include homogeneous equations, which stem from mathematical consistency requirements and physical principles and are usually imposed first, as well as inhomogeneous equations encoding limiting behavior, including the FFOPE predictions of integrability, which are usually imposed afterwards. At eight loops, the highest order currently calculated, the result for the symbol consists of 1.7 billion sequences with non-vanishing coefficients. The size of the system of linear equations constitutes a major bottleneck to bootstrapping higher loop orders, and calls for more efficient approaches.</p><p>In Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, we found that the relationship between words and their coefficients can be "learned" by machine-learning methods. In particular, we trained transformers <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, the architecture behind ChatGPT and other large-language models, to predict coefficients associated with words, after providing such models with many examples of coefficient-word pairings. Moreover, in what we called a strike-out experiment, we found indications that the coefficients of many words at L loops can be determined by coefficients of words at L -1 loops that are obtained by removing two letters from the L-loop word.</p><p>In this paper, motivated by the success of the strike-out experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, we investigate whether some of the structures implicitly found by the machine can be discovered analytically and explicitly. Indeed, we find numerous interesting examples of simple relations between coefficients of different words, sequences of words whose coefficients we can determine at any loop order, as well as recursion relations that they satisfy. Together with known linear relations from dihedral symmetry, branch-cut discontinuities, integrability, and final-entry relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>, such all-loop, recursive results could be extremely useful to assist an AI model in generalizing to all loop orders. Alternatively, the simple relations and all-loop sequences could be used to solve the bootstrap equations analytically without an explosion of unknowns in the system of linear equations.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Sec. 2, we give a brief account of the three-gluon form factor, its symbol, and its known properties. We describe simple relations among coefficients of different words at the same loop order in Sec. 3. In Sec. 4, we identify sequences of integer coefficients within the three-gluon form factor that can be inferred to all loop orders. We provide the full list of all-loop sequences we have found in an ancillary file, all8_rest_f.txt. In Sec. 5, we describe the recursion relations we found. We conclude in Sec. 6 with an outlook on future directions. Additional details of our calculations are given in a number of appendices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The three-gluon form factor and its symbol</head><p>In this section, we briefly introduce the form factor we will study throughout this paper, as well as its symbol; see refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> for more in-depth background information.</p><p>We study the three-gluon form factor of the so-called chiral half of the stress tensor supermultiplet in N = 4 SYM theory. This supermultiplet contains, in particular, the operator tr(F 2 + ), which closely resembles the operator tr(F 2 ) that couples the Higgs boson to gluons in the limit of a large top quark mass in QCD <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. Thus, the three-gluon form factor of tr(F 2 + ) is an analog, in planar N = 4 SYM theory, of the Higgs-to-three-gluon amplitude in the large-top-mass limit of QCD <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. Referring to the momenta of the three gluons as p i with i = 1, 2, 3, and to the momentum associated to the operator as q = p 1 + p 2 + p 3 , the three-gluon form factor depends on the dimensionless ratios</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">u = (p 1 + p 2 ) 2 q 2 , v = (p 2 + p 3 ) 2 q 2 , w = (p 3 + p 1 ) 2 q 2 , (<label>2.1)</label></formula><p>where u + v + w = 1. We will always work in the planar limit of a large number of colors N c ; we thus consider the leading-N c contribution to the color-ordered form factor. Since infrared (IR) divergences are universal and exponentiate, we consider a particular IR-finite part of the form factor, the so-called Bern-Dixon-Smirnov-like remainder function F <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>; see refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> for its precise definition. Henceforth, "form factor" will always refer to this function. Its perturbative expansion in the planar coupling</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">g 2 ≡ N c g 2 YM /(16π 2 ) is F (u, v) = 1 + ∞ L=1 g 2L F (L) (u, v) ,<label>(2.2)</label></formula><p>where L is the loop order. Conjecturally, the form factor F (L) at any loop order L is a two-dimensional harmonic polylogarithm (2dHPL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> of transcendental weight 2L. 2dHPLs, a particular subclass of multiple polylogarithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>, satisfy intricate identities; see Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> for a review. Hence, it has proven to be advantageous to represent these functions in terms of their co-products, and in particular via their maximally iterated co-product, the socalled symbol <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. The symbol S(F ) of a multiple polylogarithm F of transcendental weight n is defined recursively via its derivative:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">dF = i F i d log l i ⇒ S(F ) = i S(F i ) ⊗ l i ,<label>(2.3)</label></formula><p>where F i are multiple polylogarithms of weight n -1. The l i are referred to as symbol letters and L = {l i } i is referred to as the symbol alphabet. The three-gluon form factor has an alphabet consisting of only six letters, which we label {a, b, c, d, e, f }:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">a = u vw , b = v uw , c = w uv , d = 1 -u u , e = 1 -v v , f = 1 -w w . (2.4)</formula><p>While the symbol does not uniquely specify the full transcendental function, the ambiguities belong to a considerably smaller space that can be treated similarly; thus, most of the computational work performed in finding the function consists of determining its symbol. At one-loop order, the symbol of the three-gluon form factor is</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">S[F (1) ] = (-2) b ⊗ d + c ⊗ e + a ⊗ f + b ⊗ f + c ⊗ d + a ⊗ e ,<label>(2.5)</label></formula><p>while at two-loop order, it is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">S[F (2) ] = 8 b ⊗ d ⊗ d ⊗ d + c ⊗ e ⊗ e ⊗ e + a ⊗ f ⊗ f ⊗ f + b ⊗ f ⊗ f ⊗ f + c ⊗ d ⊗ d ⊗ d + a ⊗ e ⊗ e ⊗ e + 16 b ⊗ b ⊗ b ⊗ d + c ⊗ c ⊗ c ⊗ e + a ⊗ a ⊗ a ⊗ f + b ⊗ b ⊗ b ⊗ f + c ⊗ c ⊗ c ⊗ d + a ⊗ a ⊗ a ⊗ e .</formula><p>(2.6)</p><p>More generally, we can write</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">S[F (L) ] = l i 1 ,...,l i 2L ∈L C l i 1 ,...,l i 2L l i 1 ⊗ • • • ⊗ l i 2L ,<label>(2.7)</label></formula><p>where the rational coefficients C l i<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> ,...,l i 2L are integers in the conventions given by eq. (2.4). 1  Rephrasing, we can consider the symbol at loop L as a sum of 6 2L words, sequences of 2L letters drawn from the alphabet {a, b, c, d, e, f }, multiplied by integer coefficients.</p><p>In the remainder of the text, we will frequently drop the tensor product in the words for the sake of brevity, thus we write for example aaaf instead of a ⊗ a ⊗ a ⊗ f . The symbol at every loop order is left invariant by the dihedral group D 3 ≡ S 3 , which is generated by two elements, </p><p>This dihedral symmetry is a consequence of Bose symmetry, acting on the three gluons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Adjacency constraints</head><p>For most of the 6 2L words at L-loop order, the associated coefficients are zero; see table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. For instance, out of 2.8 • 10 12 words in the eight-loop symbol, only 1.67 • 10 9 (0.06%) have nonzero coefficients. We refer to the words associated with zero coefficients as zero elements.</p><p>Most zero elements can be accounted for by four adjacency rules. Specifically, words with nonzero coefficients must  Rule (i) is a branch-cut condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The other three rules follow from antipodal duality <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> as causal properties of the dual space of hexagon functions describing sixgluon scattering amplitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. Antipodal duality is presently an empirical observation.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">L = 1 L = 2 L = 3 L = 4 L = 5 L = 6 L = 7 L = Total (</formula><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> presents the number of adjacency-allowed and nonzero elements for all loops up to 8. At high loops, the adjacency rules account for most of the zero elements, and only about half of the adjacency-allowed words are zero elements. We give a method for calculating these numbers in appendix C. Other rules, discussed below, will account for most of the remaining zeroes.</p><p>The four adjacency rules impose strict conditions on the structure of words for nonzero elements (and adjacency-allowed zero elements). Rule (iv) imposes that the three letters d, e and f only appear as runs of one or more identical letters; e.g. the sub-word fff is a run that may appear in a nonzero element, but the sub-word efe cannot appear. No such constraint exists on the letters a, b and c, which can appear in any succession. As a result, adjacency-allowed words decompose into a succession of sequences of the three letters a, b and c (abc-sequences), interspersed by runs of one of the three letters d, e or f. Words must start with an abc-sequence (rule (i)) and end with a run (rule (ii)). Finally the letter in each run is constrained by rule (iii): for a run in between two abc-sequences ending and beginning with different letters (e.g. abcdddbca...), only one letter is possible. For the last run, or for runs between two abc-sequences ending and beginning with the same letter, two letters are possible. We can therefore represent any word that satisfies the adjacency relations as a succession of abc-sequences and runs: e.g. abdddccddd as ab/d 3 /cc/d 3 . This run representation will prove useful when characterizing properties of the symbol.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Other homogeneous linear relations</head><p>In addition to the rules (i)-(iv), the symbol elements satisfy a number of homogeneous linear equations. Four classes of such homogeneous equations have previously been identified. The first class of relations involves pairs of adjacent letters and takes the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">2 6 i,j=1 C ij c(Yx i x j Z) = 0 ,<label>(2.9)</label></formula><p>where C ij are specific sets of 36 small integers (most of which are zero), x i , x j denote letters in the 6-letter alphabet {a, b, c, d, e, f}, Y and Z are sub-words in these letters of any length, and c(Yx i x j Z) denotes the coefficient of the corresponding word. All such relations that hold for arbitrary Y and Z are known <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. They follow from functional integrability, i.e. from the fact that partial derivatives commute, and they hold for any choice of sub-words Y and Z as well as any loop order. For example,<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">foot_2</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_10">c(YabZ) + c(YacZ) -c(YbaZ) -c(YcaZ) = 0 ,<label>(2.10)</label></formula><p>which corresponds to setting</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">C 12 = C 13 = 1, C 21 = C 31 = -1</formula><p>, and the remaining C ij = 0 in eq. (2.9).</p><p>The second class of relations involves adjacent triplets of letters, and is of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">4 6 i 1 ,i 2 ,i 3 =1 C i 1 i 2 i 3 c(Yx i 1 x i 2 x i 3 Z) = 0 ,<label>(2.11)</label></formula><p>where the analogous C i 1 i 2 i 3 are again specific sets of small integers (mostly zero), and the notation is as before. Again, all such relations of this class that hold for any choice of sub-words Y and Z as well as any loop order are known <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. They follow from functional integrability for the six-gluon amplitude, when combined with the conjectural antipodal duality <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. We refer to eqs. (2.9) and (2.11) as generic pair and triple relations, because they hold at arbitrary positions within the symbol, because both Y and Z are of arbitrary length. The third and fourth classes of homogeneous relations are of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">6 i 1 ,...,i k =1 Ĉi 1 ...i k c(x i 1 . . . x i k Z) = 0 (2.12) i 1 ,...,i k =1 Ci 1 ...i k c(Yx i 1 . . . x i k ) = 0 . (2.13)</formula><p>We refer to eq. (2.12) as (multiple) initial-entry conditions, because they involve specific combinations of strings of k letters at the beginning of the symbol, followed by anything (Z) at the end. Most of the initial-entry conditions (2.12) follow from the (single) initial-entry (branch-cut) condition (i), the pair relations (2.9), and the triple relations (2.11), as well as further branch-cut conditions described in appendix D. The solutions to these relations have been worked out up to k = 8 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Moreover, they contain empirical relations starting at k = 4 that were observed in the data up to L = 8. The multiple final-entry conditions (2.13) follow from the multiple-initial-entry relations and functional integrability relations for the six-gluon amplitude, via antipodal duality <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Again they are labelled by an integer k, which now specifies how many letters at the end of the symbol are involved. They can in principle be worked out to any k, and this has been done explicitly up to k = 11 by using antipodal duality <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Simple linear relations</head><p>In the following, we will discuss several simple linear relations, which we observed empirically. In contrast to the previously mentioned relations discussed above, they involve sub-words of arbitrary length.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Zero-suffix rules</head><p>The first group of such relations, which we initially observed empirically, reads as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">c(Xba . . . af) = 0 , c(Xca . . . af) = 0 ,<label>(3.1)</label></formula><p>as well as its images under dihedral symmetry. Here, a . . . a denote one or more repetitions of the letter a, and X is an arbitrary sub-word. These relations impose that a nonzero word ending with a run of one letter (e.g. with af) must have only one letter in its last abc-sequence (i.e. it can end with aaaf but not baaf, even though adjacency relations allow it). These zero-suffix relations follow from the relations described in Sec. 2; see appendix B for a proof. They are specific to words ending with a run of length one. No similar rules exist for words with final runs of length 2 to 8.</p><p>The rules (3.1) account for all zero-suffixes observed in prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and of the form (2.13), and more. As shown in appendix C, table 4, the terms allowed by these rules are fairly exhaustive: by loops 7 and 8, over 92% of the terms allowed to be nonzero are actually nonzero in the symbol. We hypothesize that the only coefficient zeroes that can be associated with final strings are precisely eqs. (3.1) and no more. We call this the one-run zeroes hypothesis. In appendix C, we count the number of allowed terms under this hypothesis. We show that there are auxiliary sequences associated with the combinatorics which obey Fibonacci-like recursion relations with an asymptotic growth rate of 2 + √ 5 per weight, or (2 + √ 5) 2 ≈ 17.94 per loop. Because the number of actual nonzero symbol terms appears to approach a fixed fraction of the allowed terms, we conjecture that the asymptotic growth rate of the number of terms in the symbol is also (2 + √ 5) 2 per loop.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Zero-prefix rules</head><p>Having discussed the implications of zero-suffix rules, we now turn to zero-prefix rules.</p><p>The only zero-prefix rules we have found are</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">c(abdZ) = 0,<label>(3.2)</label></formula><p>as well as its dihedral images, for any sub-word Z. These rules involve an initial abcsequence of length 2, followed by a run for a letter that is incompatible with the first letter of the word (i.e a and d, b and e, or c and f). Relation (3.2) is a special case of the known relations (2.12), in which only one of the elements of the set Ĉi 1 ...i k is nonzero. Table <ref type="table">2</ref> presents a breakdown of the zero and nonzero elements for loops 1 to 8; see appendix C for a method for calculating these numbers. The prefix and suffix rules account for more than 99.7% of the zeroes among adjacency-allowed elements above 6 loops. That is, there are very few zeroes in the high-loop order symbol that are not explained by the adjacency, prefix or suffix rules.</p><p>The zero-prefix and zero-suffix rules concern words with a short (one letter) last run or a short (2 letter) first abc-sequence. They are not "new", in the sense that they can be inferred from previously known rules. However, some of them (namely, the suffix rules (3.1) at large weight) have not been imposed in the traditional bootstrap approach, so they might lead to additional speed-up.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Two-term relations</head><p>A second group of empirical final-entry relations holds between coefficients of two different sets of terms.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions and future work</head><p>In this paper, we have identified several interesting patterns in the symbol of the threegluon form factor. We began in Sec. 2 (and appendix C) by tabulating how many words in the symbol can have nonzero coefficients, using the known adjacency, zero-prefix and zero-suffix conditions. This number is very close to the actual number of nonzero terms in the symbol by 7 loops, and it generically obeys a Fibonacci-like relation, leading to an asymptotic growth rate per loop of (2 + √ 5) 2 . We then turned our attention to relations among the nonzero integer coefficients. In Sec. 3, we found a number of different types of simple linear relations between the coefficients of different words at the same loop order. Some of these relations could be derived from already known relations, while some are new. In Sec. 4, we observed that the coefficients of many sequences of words are given by closed-form expressions which we expect to be valid at any loop order L. In particular, sequences ending in 2Lk repeated letters f are given by the double factorial (2L -1 -2⌈k/2⌉)!! multiplied by a polynomial in L of degree ⌈k/2⌉ -1. In Sec. 5, we used the all-loop sequences to identify recursion relations that relate the coefficient of a word at a given loop order to the coefficients of particular words at lower loop orders. Taken together, these findings indicate that the three-gluon form factor exhibits much richer structure than previously anticipated!</p><p>The all-loop sequences and recursion relations do not follow in any obvious way from known properties of the form factor. It would be interesting to be able to derive them from first principles, as well as to derive further classes of identities. In the absence of such a derivation, it would be desirable to develop an automated method, potentially based on machine-learning (e.g. symbolic regression), to discover further all-loop sequences and recursion relations. In the best case, it might be possible to determine recursion relations and/or sequences that fully determine the three-gluon form factor at any loop order. Even if this is not possible, the existence of the all-loop sequences suggests a new way of solving the bootstrap equations, namely by replacing the inhomogeneous equations from the FFOPE by the inhomogeneous equations from the sequences.</p><p>As we discuss in appendix D, it is indeed possible to determine all but one of the unknowns in the ansatz for the symbol at L loops from the known homogeneous linear relations, an inhomogeneous constraint on the L th discontinuity, and the allloop sequences accessible from the data up to L -1 loops. 8 Moreover, it might be possible to avoid the proliferation of unknowns in the bootstrap by starting with the all-loop sequences and only imposing the known homogeneous constraints afterwards. For this purpose, the simple linear relations are particularly useful. While they are (conjecturally) implied by previously known relations, they suggest a simpler strategy for solving the homogeneous equations without as much proliferation of unknowns. The all-loop sequences also constitute simple inhomogeneous "seed" data, together with the simple linear relations and other homogeneous equations, that may prove useful for a numerical machine-learning model to predict the next loop order. We leave these exercises for future work.</p><p>Finally, similar simple linear relations, all-loop sequences and recursion relations might also exist for the three-gluon form factor of φ 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref> as well as the NMHV six-gluon amplitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> on the parity-preserving surface, which both share the same alphabet and for which high-loop data is equally available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C Counting allowed terms</head><p>The adjacency rules (i)-(iv) from Sec. 2 indicate that nonzero elements must begin with a, b or c, and end with d, e or f. Also, they must not have adjacent a and d, b and e, or c and f; nor adjacent d and e, d and f, or e and f. In this appendix, we derive a formula for counting the number of elements satisfying these adjacency rules. We also generalize the counting arguments to include zeroes related to multiple-final-entry relations, in particular eq. (B.1).</p><p>We first consider the 6 × 6 transition matrix encoding the rules (iii) and (iv):</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">U =          1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1          , (C.1)</formula><p>where entries of U indicate the allowed sequences of two of the six letters: U 1,2 = 1 because b can follow a, but U 1,4 = 0 because d cannot follow a. Moreover, we consider the initial and final vectors I = (1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0) and F 1 = (0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1), which encode rules (i) and (ii), respectively.

Explicit values of N adj (2L) for L = 1, . . . , 8 are given in the middle row of table 1, and again in the top row of table <ref type="table">2</ref>. Because the adjacency rules (i)-(iv) respect dihedral symmetry, we can compress the transition matrix U into a two-dimensional one, Û.

Formula (C.3) can be generalized to take into account zeroes that might arise from the many linear relations among the last k entries <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. For example, the triple-finalentry conditions (k = 3) include some zeroes that are not consequences of the pair adjacency relations, namely</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">c(Xbaf) = c(Xcaf) = 0 , (C.10)</formula><p>plus dihedral images of these relations. Eq. (C.10) is a special case of eq. (B.1). Applying all of the k = 3 relations, we find that there are 4 nonzero final triplets starting with a and 5 nonzero triplets starting with d, or F a 3 = 4, F d 3 = 5. In general, if we know the vector Fk ≡ (F a k , F d k ), then we can compute the "k-improved" number of allowed nonzero elements,</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">N(k, L) = Î Û2L-k F T k , for k ≤ 2L.

(This prediction could be tested using the antipodally-dual weight-9 hexagon function space on the parity-preserving surface.) Now we will show that eqs. (C.12) follow from the one-run zeroes hypothesis. This hypothesis is that the only zeroes associated with multi-final-entry conditions are for Xba . . . af and Xca . . . af and their dihedral images, i.e. eq. (3.1). Given the letter d, any sub-word starting with b or c, or d can sit behind it. Thus,</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">F d k = 2F a k-1 + F d k-1 . (C.13)</formula><p>On the other hand, we need to divide F a k into F a k -2 and 2, where the latter 2 is associated with the two sub-words a . . . ae and a . . . af. Due to eq. (3.1), these latter sub-words each generate one new sub-word at the next value of k, whereas the F a k -2 can have all 3 of a, b, c prepended to them. Thus,</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">F a k = 3(F a k-1 -2) + 2 + 2F d k-1 (C.14) = 3F a k-1 + 2F d k-1 -4 ,</formula><p>where the last term on the first line (2F d k-1 ) counts sub-words of the form aeZ and afZ, for some sub-word Z. It is straightforward to combine eqs. (C.13) and (C.14) with the same equations with k → k -1, in order to derive eqs. (C.12). For example,</p><formula xml:id="formula_51">F a k -4F a k-1 = -F k-1 + 2F d k-1 -4 = -(3F a k-2 + 2F d k-1 -4) + 2(2F a k-2 + F d k-2 ) -4 = F a k-2 . (C.15)</formula><p>Notice that the form of eqs. (C.12) is very similar to eqs. (C.7). At large k, the constant term -8 is negligible, and the asymptotic growth rate for F a k and F d k is the same as it is for N a j and N d j , namely 2 + √ 5. Using eq. (C.11) and table 3, we give the number of k-improved allowed nonzero elements in table 4. The number decreases with k, but the decrease from k = 7 to k = 8 (say) is not very great, and the decrease stops once k = 2L. The k = ∞ line assumes the one-run zeroes hypothesis.

In the top line, we impose the constraints on the k final entries, k = 5, 6, 7, 8. In the next line, we add the all-loop constraint that we know all sequences ending in 6 f's. In the line after that, we apply the L th discontinuity constraint (but not f 6 ). In the final line, we add both the f 6 and L th discontinuity constraints, arriving at a single unknown parameter. One then collects the terms with symbol letters now only belonging to a,c, and requires those terms preceding each f to vanish. We also impose the empirical multi-initial-entry relations mentioned at the end of Sec. 2.</p><p>There is also a known constraint on the L th discontinuity of the form factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The L th discontinuity is computed by clipping L letters off the front of the symbol. However, the letter that is supposed to be clipped is w, which corresponds to the operation This constraint is also "semi-local", involving more and more terms at higher loops. At all loop orders from 3 to 7, we solved the linear equations resulting from these constraints, and counted how many unknown parameters were left. Table <ref type="table">5</ref> shows the results at 5 loops. Even imposing up to 8-final-entry conditions, there are still 9 parameters left. If we impose knowledge of the elements ending in 6 f's, the number of parameters is reduced to 4. If we instead impose the L th discontinuity constraint, it also leaves 4 parameters. But if we impose both f 6 and the L th discontinuity constraint, there is a single parameter left.</p><p>Remarkably, for L = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 there is a single parameter left as well, after imposing the same set of constraints as in table 5, including fe k for k ≤ 8, f L+1 , and the L th discontinuity. At L = 2, there is no parameter left, i.e. the answer is uniquely determined. At L = 8, we have not yet performed the analysis, but we conjecture it that there is exactly one parameter left also for L ≥ 8. Also somewhat remarkably, the "ambiguity function" multiplying the one parameter at L = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 vanishes in the strict collinear limit. It can be fixed by the FFOPE, using the first nontrivial (leading-logarithmic) contribution to the FFOPE.</p><p>In conclusion, the all-loop information about sequences ending in (L+1) f's is quite powerful, and quite complementary to the L th discontinuity constraint, leaving behind, at symbol level, a single unknown parameter to fix using the FFOPE information. Perhaps another all-loop sequence can be found that fixes it, without having to resort to the FFOPE at all. It will also be very interesting to see to what extent an AI model can learn all the types of constraints used in this analysis (or alternative ones).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>3 Figure 1 .</head><label>31</label><figDesc>Figure1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Adjacencies in abc-sequences</head><p>In this appendix, we describe the generic pair and triple relations, which were given schematically in eqs. (2.9) and <ref type="bibr">(2.11)</ref>. We also show how to combine some of these relations in order to move around the composite letter (abc). The latter relations are then used to prove relation <ref type="bibr">3.4.</ref> Underlying the investigations in this paper are the functional integrability relations of the form (2.9), which read <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> c(YabZ) + c(YacZ) = c(YbaZ) + c(YcaZ) , In other words, for any partition of a given abc-sequence A into A 1 A 2 , all coefficients c(YA 1 (abc)A 2 Z) have exactly the same value. Now from the final-entry condition (ii), Z must contain at least one of d, e, or f, and by adjusting A 2 , one of these letters can be put at the start of Z. Assume, without loss of generality, that Z begins with f. Then cZ violates the adjacency condition (iv) and so we have c(YA 1 (abc)A 2 Z) = c(YA(abc)Z) = c(YAaZ) + c(YAbZ) .</p><p>(A.8) Also, relation (A.4) asserts that c(Ya(abc)bZ) = 0 . (A.9)</p><p>If A includes at least two different letters, then relation (A.9) applies in at least one position of A, and the collections of equal coefficients in (A.7) actually all vanish,</p><p>Besides providing the pair and triple relations, in this appendix we have established many relations between coefficients involving the composite letter (abc).</p><p>We will now show how the relations (3.4) given in Sec. 3.3 follow from the above relations. We repeat eq. (3.4) for the convenience of the reader:</p><p>First consider the case that A contains only a single letter, and that it is a. (If the single letter is b, it is the same by dihedral symmetry.) Specifically, we let A = a n , for n ≥ 1, and we wish to show that c(Yfa n+1 bfZ) = c(Yfba n+1 fZ) = -c(Yfba n bfZ) .</p><p>(A.12)</p><p>We can derive the first eq. (A.12) from cf non-adjacency, plus the commutativity property (A.7) of the composite letter (abc) demonstrated in appendix A:</p><p>For the second eq. (A.12) we consider the difference of the middle and right sides of the equation, which is c(Yfba n (abc)fZ). We commute (abc) to the left until it sits between b and a. Then we use a dihedral image of eq. (A.9) to conclude that c(Yfba n (abc)fZ) vanishes.</p><p>Next consider the case that A has two different letters. We first show that </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B A proof of zero-suffix relations</head><p>In this appendix, we prove the relations (3.1) presented in Sec. 3.1, which we repeat here for the convenience of the reader:</p><p>They and their dihedral images hold for any sub-word X.</p><p>The validity of rule (B.1) for all length of suffixes and all loops can be proven by induction on the length of the suffixes. Specifically, we will show that, for any n ≥ 1, words ending in ba n f and ca n f (and their dihedral equivalents) have zero coefficients. For n = 1, i.e. for suffixes baf, caf, this rule is the antipodal dual of allowed-weight three hexagon functions for the six-gluon scattering <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. For n &gt; 1, we will use the constraint on adjacent triples (A.4):</p><p>The first equation follows from eq. (A.4) by the dihedral flip a ↔ b, while the second equation follows from the first one by the dihedral flip b ↔ c. Thus, eq. (B.2) requires the sum of three coefficients to vanish. Suppose we know that all strings ending in ba n f and ca n f have a vanishing coefficient. Then in particular we know that all strings ending in bba n f and bca n f vanish. By the first eq. (B.2), we know that all strings ending in baa n f vanish. Similarly, using the second eq. (B.2), all strings ending in caa n f vanish. We have therefore proven that words ending in ba n+1 f and ca n+1 f have vanishing coefficients. By induction on n, all words ending in ba n f and ca n f have vanishing coefficients, for any n ≥ 1. Thus we have proven that the rules (B.1) can be deduced from antipodal duality <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and the constraints from Ref. <ref type="bibr">[</ref> k = ∞. There is very little difference between k = 8 and k = ∞. For L ≥ 4, this fraction increases monotonically with L, reaching 93% by L = 8. Thus the majority of the zeroes can be understood to stem from the adjacency relations together with the k-final-entry relations. On the other hand, the absolute number of "unexplained" zeroes, N(8, L)actual, still increases quickly with L.</p><p>If we subtract the k = ∞ line of table 4 from the "adjacency-allowed" line of table 2, we obtain the "suffix-forbidden" line of table 2. Next we need to count the number of prefix-forbidden elements that are left. This number is just 6 F d 2L-2 , because 6 types of strings with a d-type letter in the third symbol slot have to be removed, and the number of each type that is allowed by the suffix rules is just F d k for k = 2L -2. Subtracting the suffix-and prefix-forbidden elements from the adjacency-allowed elements gives the remaining allowed elements in table 2. Then it is just a matter of comparing this number with the actual number of nonzero terms in the symbol <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>At L = 2, there are 42 unexplained zeroes which fall into seven 6-orbits under the dihedral group. Representatives of the seven orbits are abdd, aecd, bbdd, bcdd, bdbd, bdcd, bfbd.</p><p>(C.16)</p><p>The first of the seven orbits can be explained because abdd doesn't appear in the 48dimensional space of allowed first-four entries. This is part of the prefix rule (3.2). But the other six vanishing 6-orbits at two loops do not seem to have a simple explanation.</p><p>There is still considerably more to understand about the unexplained zeroes at high loop order. In summary, in this appendix we computed the number of allowed terms in the symbol due to the adjacency relations and the k-final-entry conditions, in particular the suffix rules <ref type="bibr">(3.1)</ref>. We also counted the number of terms forbidden by the prefix rule (3.2). We found that the auxiliary sequences N a j , N d j , F a k , F d k all obey Fibonaccilike sequences with a growth rate of 2 + √ 5 per weight, or (2 + √ 5) 2 per loop. This rate originates as one of the eigenvalues of the matrix Û in eq. (C.4). This rate will control N(k, L) for any fixed k. It will also control the improved number of allowed terms that takes into account the prefix rule (3.2). From the last line of table 2, the ratio of the actual number of terms to the remaining allowed terms is over 99.8% by L = 8. Hence it is very likely that the actual number of nonzero terms in the symbol also has an asymptotic growth rate per loop of (2 + √ 5) 2 ≈ 17.94.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D Bootstrapping using all-loop sequences</head><p>In this appendix, we analyse the power of all-loop sequences and empirical linear relations, demonstrating their potential to improve the symbol bootstrap approach. Suppose we wish to train an AI model to predict loop orders that are (mostly) not yet known. Suppose that the AI model can learn all of the known relations in Sec. 2 that include dihedral symmetry (2.8), integrability (A.1)-(A.3), the adjacency rules, and the k-final-entry conditions. The multi-final-entry conditions are related by antipodal duality to the hexagon function space, so we suppose we know what they are for any k.</p><p>Lets also suppose that we can enforce a branch-cut condition and a constraint on the L th discontinuity, discussed below. In addition, as described at the end of Sec. 4, at L loops we should have available all-loop results for all sequences ending in (L + 1) f's. Is that enough to fix the form factor completely at a given loop order L?</p><p>When the form-factor function space is constructed, it is natural to include a branchcut condition. This condition is only "semi-local", by which we mean that it involves an increasingly large number of terms in the {a, b, c, d, e, f } alphabet at higher loop orders. The branch-cut condition states that if there is an f in the symbol, then in the kinematical region where f vanishes (w → 1, u, v → 0), the terms preceding the f should vanish. One sets </p></div>			</div>
