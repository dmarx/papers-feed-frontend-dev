- **Three-Gluon Form Factor**: The form factor \( F \) is defined in terms of dimensionless variables:
  \[
  u = \frac{(p_1 + p_2)^2}{q^2}, \quad v = \frac{(p_2 + p_3)^2}{q^2}, \quad w = \frac{(p_3 + p_1)^2}{q^2}, \quad \text{with } u + v + w = 1.
  \]

- **Perturbative Expansion**: The form factor's perturbative expansion is given by:
  \[
  F(u, v) = 1 + \sum_{L=1}^{\infty} g^{2L} F^{(L)}(u, v),
  \]
  where \( g^2 \equiv \frac{N_c g^2_{YM}}{16\pi^2} \).

- **Symbol Definition**: The symbol \( S(F) \) of a multiple polylogarithm \( F \) is defined recursively:
  \[
  dF = \sum_i F_i d \log l_i \Rightarrow S(F) = \sum_i S(F_i) \otimes l_i.
  \]

- **Symbol Alphabet**: The three-gluon form factor has a symbol alphabet consisting of six letters:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  a &= u vw, \\
  b &= v uw, \\
  c &= w uv, \\
  d &= 1 - u u, \\
  e &= 1 - v v, \\
  f &= 1 - w w.
  \end{align*}
  \]

- **Symbol at Loop Orders**:
  - At one loop:
    \[
    S[F^{(1)}] = (-2)b \otimes d + c \otimes e + a \otimes f + b \otimes f + c \otimes d + a \otimes e.
    \]
  - At two loops:
    \[
    S[F^{(2)}] = 8b \otimes d \otimes d \otimes d + c \otimes e \otimes e \otimes e + \ldots
    \]

- **Adjacency Rules**: Four adjacency rules govern the structure of words with nonzero coefficients:
  1. Words must start with an abc-sequence.
  2. Words must end with a run of letters \( d, e, f \).
  3. Runs between different abc-sequences must consist of only one letter.
  4. Runs can consist of one or more identical letters.

- **Recursion Relations**: Coefficients of words can be related to coefficients of lower-loop words, allowing for recursive calculations.

- **Machine Learning Insights**: Machine learning methods have been employed to predict coefficients associated with words, revealing patterns and potential simplifications in the coefficient structure.

- **Homogeneous Linear Relations**: The coefficients satisfy several homogeneous linear equations, which can be expressed in terms of adjacent letters:
  \[
  2 \sum_{i,j=1}^{6} C_{ij} c(Y x_i x_j Z) = 0.
  \]

- **Dihedral Symmetry**: The symbol at every loop order is invariant under the dihedral group \( D_3 \), reflecting the Bose symmetry of the three gluons.

- **Future Directions**: The findings suggest potential pathways for analytically solving bootstrap equations and extending results to all loop orders.
