  "abstract": "The planar three-gluon form factor for the chiral stress tensor operator in\nplanar maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory is an analog of the\nHiggs-to-three-gluon scattering amplitude in QCD. The amplitude (symbol)\nbootstrap program has provided a wealth of high-loop perturbative data about\nthis form factor, with results up to eight loops available. The symbol of the\nform factor at $L$ loops is given by words of length $2L$ in six letters with\nassociated integer coefficients. In this paper, we analyze this data,\ndescribing patterns of zero coefficients and relations between coefficients. We\nfind many sequences of words whose coefficients are given by closed-form\nexpressions which we expect to be valid at any loop order. Moreover, motivated\nby our previous machine-learning analysis, we identify simple recursion\nrelations that relate the coefficient of a word to the coefficients of\nparticular lower-loop words. These results open an exciting door for\nunderstanding scattering amplitudes at all loop orders.",
