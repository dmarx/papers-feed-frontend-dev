## Abstract

## 

We present a complete analysis of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data of GRB 221009A, the brightest Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) ever detected. The burst emission above 30 MeV detected by the LAT preceded by 1 s the low-energy (< 10 MeV) pulse that triggered the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM), as has been observed in other GRBs. The prompt phase of GRB 221009A lasted a few hundred seconds. It was so bright that we identify a Bad Time Interval (BTI) of 64 seconds caused by the extremely high flux of hard X-rays and soft gamma rays, during which the event reconstruction efficiency was poor and the dead time fraction quite high. The late-time emission decayed as a power law, but the extrapolation of the late-time emission during the first 450 seconds suggests that the afterglow started during the prompt emission. We also found that high-energy events observed by the LAT are incompatible with synchrotron origin, and, during the prompt emission, are more likely related to an extra component identified as synchrotron self-Compton (SSC). A remarkable 400 GeV photon, detected by the LAT 33 ks after the GBM trigger and directionally consistent with the location of GRB 221009A, is hard to explain as a product of SSC or TeV electromagnetic cascades, and the process responsible for its origin is uncertain. Because of its proximity and energetic nature, GRB 221009A is an extremely rare event.

## INTRODUCTION

Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are extremely powerful events lighting up the gamma-ray sky approximately once per day, with the bulk of their emission extending from several keV to tens of MeV. They have been detected regularly since the late 1960s by many dedicated space missions, with a total of many thousands of events. The promptly emitted gamma-ray radiation on timescales of seconds is followed by a longer-lasting afterglow emission revealed at every wavelength (from radio to TeV gamma rays) on timescales extending to days, months, even years.

The Large Area Telescope (LAT, [Atwood et al. 2009](#b22)) onboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, operating since 2008, opened a new window to explore GRB emission in the GeV domain, establishing important spectral and temporal properties of the high-energy (> 0.1 GeV) burst emission [(Ajello et al. 2019)](#b15).

For almost a decade, GRB 130427A held many records among all LAT-detected GRBs [(Ackermann et al. 2014)](#b8), including the highest fluence (1.3±0.2×10 -4 erg cm -2 in the 0.1-100 GeV energy range), the highest energy photon (94 GeV at T 0 + 243 s; with T 0 referring to the burst trigger), the largest number of > 0.1 GeV-photons recorded from a GRB (> 600, with 17 events above 10 GeV) and the longest high-energy duration 34.4 ± 0.3 ks (∼10 hrs). Despite its intensity and proximity at z = 0.34, no very-high-energy (> 0.1 TeV, VHE) emission was detected by any ground-based experiment at the time. The VERITAS array reported bright moonlight conditions precluding observations at the time of trigger [(Aliu et al. 2014](#b17)) and follow-up could not be initiated until ∼ 71 ks (∼20 hrs) after the onset of the burst, leading to upper limit derivations and constraints.

VHE emission was finally detected from a GRB a few years later, both at very early times (from 1 to 40 min after the GRB onset) as in the case of GRB 190114C (z = 0.42) observed by the MAGIC telescopes at energies 0.3 -1 TeV [(MAGIC Collaboration et al. 2019)](#) as well as in the afterglow regime (∼ 4 -10 hrs after the GRB onset) for GRB 180720B (z = 0.65) and for GRB 190829A (z = 0.078), both observed by the H.E.S.S. telescopes at energies 0.1 -0.44 TeV [(Abdalla et al. 2019](#b3)) and 0.18 -3.3 TeV (H. E. S. S. [Collaboration et al. 2021)](#), respectively, or GRB 201216C observed by MAGIC at redshift z = 1.1 [(Abe et al. 2024)](#b5). All these remarkable afterglow detections at TeV energies have been favored by the proximity of the bursts, preventing such high-energy emission from being severely attenuated by pair production against the the extragalactic background light (EBL, [Finke et al. 2010)](#b37). Interestingly, none of these three breakthrough detections was accompanied by extraordinary MeV/GeV emission. In fact, the highest-energy photons detected by the LAT were 21 and 5 GeV for GRB 190114C and GRB 180720B, respectively, while the LAT detected no prompt or afterglow high-energy emission in the case of GRB 190829A [(Piron et al. 2019)](#b68). The MeV emission is thought to arise mainly from synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons in the jet plasma due to ultra-relativistic bulk motion. The same synchrotron component also likely dominates the LAT emission; however an additional high-energy spectral component is typically needed to explain emission at energies ≳ 10 GeV that exceeds the maximum energy of synchrotron photons at late times [(Ackermann et al. 2014;](#b8)[Ajello et al. 2020](#)). Thus, Fermi -LAT covers the key energy band in which the transition of the GRB emission mechanism occurs.

Here we report the Fermi -LAT observation and interpretation of the highest-energy emission ever measured from a GRB. GRB 221009A is so bright that it allowed a complete spectral and temporal analysis to be performed from keV to TeV energy from the triggering pulse to the late afterglow. For the first time, rapid spectral variability in the LAT during the prompt emission clearly revealed the simultaneous presence of the afterglow, which extended up to several TeV, with the prompt emission. The spectrum shows clear evidence of synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) and its evolution with time is presented in this paper. GRB 221009A broke many previous records, not only at high energies, but over many energy bands, quickly deserving the title of the "Brightest Of All Time", or the "B.O.A.T." GRB [(Burns et al. 2023a)](#).

This event was so strong and long-lived that it was detected by dozens of space-and groundbased observatories, caused even a sudden disturbance of the Earth's ionosphere [(Schnoor et al. 2022)](#b76), and resulted in more than 120 rapid observation reports and communications on the General Coordinate Network (GCN) and via The Astronomer's Telegram service. Over 100 publications, including the detection of gamma-rays from AGILE [(Tavani et al. 2023](#b78)), discussions about X-ray polarization [(Negro et al. 2023)](#b62), radio observations [(Laskar et al. 2023)](#b52), and optical observations [(Fulton et al. 2023)](#b39), as well as several follow-up campaigns carried out by e.g. VHE telescopes [(Aharonian et al. 2023](#b12)) and neutrino observatories [(Abbasi et al. 2023)](#), have been published to date.

The Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) onboard Fermi was the first detector to trigger on GRB 221009A on 2022 October 9, at 13:16:59.988 UT (trigger 221009553 / 687014224) [(Lesage et al. 2023](#b54)). We will refer to this time as T 0 of the burst throughout the text. Unfortunately, prompt notices containing classification and localization information were not immediately distributed to the community through standard procedure due to issues in the ground segment [(Lesage et al. 2023)](#b54). Therefore, the LAT GRB pipeline, the so-called "LAT Transient Factory" (LTF, [Vianello et al. 2015a)](#b83) did not automatically receive and process this event. About an hour after the trigger, at 14:10:17 UT (T 0 + 3197 s), the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) reported the detection of a very bright hard X-ray, soft X-ray, and UV/optical transient. BAT tentatively classified it as a new source called Swift J1913.1 + 1946 [(Dichiara et al. 2022)](#b34) with possible Galactic origin given the proximity (4 deg) to the Galactic plane. This trigger was successfully received by the LTF and the resulting preliminary analysis immediately revealed a high-energy detection with high significance [(Bissaldi et al. 2022)](#b25), with the highest-energy event being a 7.7 GeV photon detected 766 s after the BAT trigger. Meanwhile, the initial GBM trigger had been analyzed and found to be spatially consistent with the BAT and LAT localizations [(Lesage et al. 2022)](#b53). GBM data revealed a first emission episode with duration of ∼ 40 s, followed by a second much longer and extremely bright emission episode, affected by strong pulse pile-up and other systematic effects[foot_0](#foot_0) . The preliminary GBMreported peak flux and fluence clearly indicated that GRB 221009A was the most intense and fluent burst detected throughout the lifetime of the Fermi mission. Following the GBM notice, a new analysis was immediately initiated covering the first 3200 s. This revealed an extremely bright and structured emission episode temporally coincident with the GBM main emission episode starting at T 0 + 200 s and a highest-energy photon of 99.3 GeV at T 0 + 240 s, which represented the highest photon energy ever detected by the LAT [(Pillera et al. 2022](#b67)) associated with a GRB . However, as first reported in [Xia et al. (2022)](#b87), LAT detected an even more energetic photon with an energy of 400 GeV ∼ 9 hrs after the GBM trigger [(Xia et al. 2024)](#). Over the following days, more than 100 different teams reported follow-up observations and different preliminary analyses of GRB 221009A. The first redshift measurement of z = 0.151 was provided by the X-shooter/VLT Team 11.5 hrs after the GBM trigger (de Ugarte [Postigo et al. 2022)](#b33), and a spectroscopic redshift confirmation (z = 0.1505) came from the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio de Canarias [(GTC, Castro-Tirado et al. 2022)](#). Another remarkable feature of the burst afterglow was detected in the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT) analysis, which produced a stacked image in the 0.3 -10 keV energy band, showing a complex system of expanding dust-scattering rings with radii from about 2.5 to 7.5 arcmin [(Tiengo et al. 2023a;](#b79)[Vasilopoulos et al. 2023)](#b81), a system that was also observed by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE, [Negro et al. 2023)](#b62), and X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission (XMM-Newton, [Tiengo et al. 2023b)](#).

Searches for neutrino and gravitational-wave counterparts around the time of the burst did not result in detections (KM3NeT Collaboration 2022; [Ai & Gao 2023;](#b13)[Abbasi et al. 2023)](#). Additionally, the full moon on the night of October 9, 2022 prevented all major IACT telescopes (MAGIC, H.E.S.S. and VERITAS) from immediately following up the event. The High-Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC) reported no detection in the burst region ∼ 8 hours after the GBM trigger [(Ayala & HAWC Collaboration 2022)](#).

Two unexpected discoveries were announced by ground-based experiments a couple of days after the trigger. First, the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) collaboration reported the detection of > 500 GeV photons within 2000 seconds of the GBM trigger, with a significance greater than 100 standard deviations by the WDCA instrument. Moreover, LHAASO-KM2A observed a record-breaking 18 TeV photon coming from the direction of GRB 221009A with a significance of 10 standard deviations [(Huang et al. 2022)](#b46). Following the LHAASO announcement, an even more remarkable claim was made by the Carpet-2 air-shower array collaboration, reporting the unprecedented detection of a 250 TeV photon-like air shower at T 0 + 4536 s [(Dzhappuev et al. 2022](#b35)), but, to date, no confirmation of it has been published in the literature. Finally, the discovery of a MeV emission line in the spectrum of GRB 221009A was announced by [Ravasio et al. (2024)](#b72), and will be also discussed later in this paper.

This paper is organized as follows: In Sec. 2 we present the LAT analysis, including the special treatment of the data during the Bad Time Interval (BTI). In Sec. 3 we collect the results of the analysis of the triggering pulse, of the prompt emission and on the temporally extended emission. In Sec. 4 we model the high-energy emission from prompt to afterglow, disentangling the contribution from internal shocks from that of the external shock, that was responsible for the late-time emission. In this section we also present a broad-band modeling of the prompt emission combining LAT and GBM data, which indicates the presence of an extra high-energy component needed to describe the data. Finally, we compare GRB 221009A with the other LAT-detected GRBs. Summary and conclusions are drawn in Sec. 5. In this paper two appendices are provided: App. A presents the details of the analysis performed to measure the flux during the brightest part of the GRB; App. B collects additional information on the GBM-LAT joint fit.

## ANALYSIS METHODS AND PROCEDURES

The LAT instrument [(Atwood et al. 2009](#b22)) comprises three subsystems: a tracker with 18 (x, y) tracking planes of silicon strip detectors interleaved with tungsten layers, a segmented calorimeter made of CsI(Tl) crystals and an anticoincidence detector (ACD) made of plastic scintillator tiles. The tracker induces e + e -pair conversion of the incident gamma ray and measures its direction. The energy of the electromagnetic shower induced by the e + e -pair is measured in the calorimeter. The energy of the incident gamma-ray is estimated using information from both the tracker and calorimeter. The role of the ACD is to reject the charged cosmic-ray background. Due to the peculiar brightness of this GRB, the X-ray and soft gamma-ray (E ≲ 30 MeV) flux was so intense during the brightest part of the emission that it produced a very high level of additional hits and energy deposits in all three subsystems [(Omodei et al. 2022)](#b65). Because the instrument and the event reconstruction were not designed to deal with such conditions, we have to carefully identify the time

The Fermi LAT collaboration interval (flagged as BTI) during which standard analysis methods cannot be used, either fermitools[foot_1](#foot_1) or the LAT Low Energy Event technique, LLE [(Pelassa et al. 2010;](#b66)[Ajello et al. 2014)](#b14), which require that the standard instrument response functions (IRFs) correctly model the instrument response.

## Dedicated data analysis of the brightest part of the GRB prompt emission

Shortly after launch, it was realized that a significant fraction of the recorded events[foot_2](#foot_2) contained, in addition to the signals due to the triggering particle, the remnants of the signals due to a particle that passed through the instrument a few µs before the trigger was issued [(Ackermann et al. 2012)](#b7). Part of the Pass 8 effort [(Atwood et al. 2013](#b21)) to improve the event reconstruction was dedicated to mitigate the effect of these so-called ghost signals. It required modifying the instrument simulation to correctly take into account the presence of these spurious out-of-time signals. Together with the electronic noise, they constitute the background noise with respect to the signals of the triggering particle. Hence we refer to these spurious out-of-time signals as an additional noise. This noise was actually captured with events that are recorded independently of the activity in the instrument thanks to a 2 Hz PERIODIC trigger (PT). Almost all of these ghosts correspond to only one out-oftime particle. Therefore, the event reconstruction and selection were designed to be as insensitive as possible to this additional noise.

Fig. [1](#) shows the number of fired strips in the tracker as a function of time for events with at least one track that passed the main gamma-ray trigger and on-board filter, as well as for the PT events[foot_3](#foot_3) . Both before (T 0 + ∼ 217 s) and after (T 0 + ∼ 280 s) the main episode of the GRB, there are a few PT events with more than 10 strips that correspond to the remnants of out-of-time cosmic rays, but most of the PT events contain less than 10 strips (the majority of them having no signal in the tracker), which characterizes normal conditions of data taking. On the contrary, during most of the time interval [T 0 + ∼ 217 s, T 0 + ∼ 280 s] the number of fired strips in PT events is greater than 10 and it can even exceed 100. Due to the very high deadtime, only a few PT events could be recorded during the brightest parts of the burst. However, we can use the bottom edge of the main-trigger event distribution (black dots in Fig. [1](#)) to estimate the noise in the tracker as a function of time: it exceeds 100 during two peaks of activity, for T-T 0 between 225 and 236 s and between 257 and 265 s. The intense X-ray and soft gamma-ray flux of the GRB also affected the calorimeter and the anti-coincidence detector. As a consequence, the event reconstruction and selection are strongly impacted and the standard Instrument Response Functions (IRFs) cannot be expected to be valid during all the prompt emission.

A detailed assessment of the effect of the X-ray and soft gamma-ray flux on the LAT is presented in App. A, as well as the dedicated analysis that we develop to be able to measure the flux of the GRB during its brightest period, which includes a special event reconstruction and selection. Here we summarize the main findings. In the following, because we need to follow the 1 s binning of the information stored in the LAT pointing and livetime history file and because the GRB happened to reach the LAT out of phase by 0.4 s with respect to this 1 s binning, the times with respect to the GRB trigger are given with a decimal part of 0.6 s.

Figure [1](#). Number of hit strips in the tracker in the events with at least one track that pass the gamma-ray main trigger and on-board filter as a function of time since the GBM trigger (black dots). The red dots correspond to events triggered with a 2 Hz cadence to monitor the noise (both electronic and physical) in the instrument. For clarity's sake, events with no hit strips are plotted with y = -0.1. The blue histogram shows the live time recorded in the 1 second spacecraft file. During normal data taking conditions (before T 0 ∼ 217 s and after T 0 + ∼ 280 s) the noise in the tracker can be very low (at most one strip), while during the brightest part of the GRB prompt emission it is never empty and can reach more than 100 strips. It can be noted that, because of the very high deadtime during the burst, which is a consequence of the extremely high GRB flux, the periodic trigger 2 Hz cadence could not be sustained.

Regarding the standard energy measurement, we find that the noise contamination is greater than 10 MeV during almost all the time interval [T 0 + 217.6 s, T 0 + 273.6 s] and that it is beyond 100 MeV during [T 0 + 225.6 s, T 0 + 235.6 s] and [T 0 + 257.6 s, T 0 + 264.6 s]. We use the fraction of events with some fired strips in the tracker top corner facing the GRB direction to monitor the level of noise. It is 2% during normal conditions and we use the times when it becomes > 3.5% and then < 3.5% to define the start and end of the BTI: [T 0 + 216.6 s, T 0 + 280.6 s].

As explained in App. A, to overcome the impact of the extra noise during this time interval, we use an energy estimator based only on the tracker information around the track. We select events passing the trigger and the on-board filter, with at least one track. Thanks to Earth-limb data and multi-photon simulations, we estimate the selection efficiency as a function of the noise level, and thus as a function of time. We require the event energy to be greater than 160 MeV so that the false positive rate is low enough. We calculate the GRB flux in 5 s intervals by fitting the distribution of the angular separation to the GRB with templates based on data and simulation.

## The fitting procedure

To perform all the fits in this analysis, except during the BTI, we used ThreeML [(Vianello et al. 2015b](#)), a python-based software package for parameter inference using the maximum likelihood formalism (with Bayesian posterior sampling supported as well). The likelihood calculation, including an interface to instrument response files and reading in data, is encapsulated in plugins, each corre-

The Fermi LAT collaboration sponding to a certain instrument or data format, allowing joint likelihood fits of datasets recorded by different instruments. GBM and LLE data can be imported in ThreeML using the OGIPLike plugin, which supports any type of file format based on an OGIP[foot_4](#foot_4) standard, while for the LAT dataset we used two different plugins, FermiLATLike for un-binned analysis (which interfaces with gtburst[foot_5](#foot_5) , part of the fermitools), and FermipyLike for binned likelihood analysis via and interface to fermipy [(Wood et al. 2017)](#b86). Depending on the instrumental conditions and on the viewing angle of GRB 221009A, we combine different datasets and use different plugins. In all our analyses we use the best-known localization R.A. = 288 • .264587, Dec. (J2000) = 19 • .773397 reported by [Atri et al. (2022)](#b20).

## RESULTS

Fig. [2](#) shows the Fermi broad band light curve, with two NaI detectors (n4, n7), a BGO detector (b1), the LLE and LAT light curves, as well as the LAT TRANSIENT 010E events with energies greater than 100 MeV. We identify as the triggering pulse the emission episode from T 0 to T 0 + 20 s (left panel), while the entire prompt emission lasting approximately 10 minutes is shown in the right panel.

## The triggering pulse

We first subdivide this interval by performing a Bayesian Blocks analysis [(Scargle et al. 2013](#b75)) on LLE data [(Pelassa et al. 2010;](#b66)[Ajello et al. 2014)](#b14), obtaining 3 time intervals. In order to perform a spectral analysis over a wider energy range, we included also low-energy (< 10 MeV) data collected by the GBM and followed the prescriptions of the GBM Team [(Lesage et al. 2023)](#b54) in terms of detectors and data format selection, avoiding data types possibly affected by pulse pile-up effects. We used data from detectors n4, n7 and b1, which have the best viewing angles with respect to the source, and are not affected by any blockage by the spacecraft or solar panels, in their nominal energy ranges. In particular, we analyzed TTE (Time-Tagged Event, [Meegan et al. 2009](#b58)) data in the time interval prior to the main emission episode (from T 0 -0.69 s to T 0 + 19.95 s, the triggering pulse analysis). We used detector response files (RSP files) specifically produced by the GBM Team for GRB 221009A [(Lesage et al. 2023)](#b54). For the spectral analysis of the triggering pulse we used LLE data from 30 MeV to 100 MeV, and TRANSIENT 010E (> 100 MeV) event class LAT data[foot_6](#foot_6) .

First, we tested different phenomenological spectral models, including a simple power law (PL), Band, Comptonized (COMP) -as defined in the GBM GRB spectral catalog [(Poolakkil et al. 2021](#b69)) -and a double smoothly broken power law (2SBPL, [Ravasio et al. 2018)](#b71). We also tested for the presence of an extra PL for the COMP, Band and 2SBPL models. To compare different models, we used the Bayesian Information Criterion, defined as: BIC = k ln(N )-2 ln(L), where k is the number of free parameters of the model, N is the number of data points (equivalent to the number of spectral bins in a binned analysis or to the number of events in an un-binned analysis), and L is the value of the likelihood. In Tab. 1 we summarize the values for the BIC of the different models tested. The models that best describe the triggering pulse with the lowest BIC are COMP and Band, but the parameters of the Band model are not well constrained in all time intervals. In particular, the first two time bins result in a Band parameter β value of -4.0, which is extremely soft, and an unconstrained E peak . In LAT events Figure 2. Left: light curve of the first 20 seconds after the GBM trigger (T 0 ) demonstrating the bright triggering pulse; Right: light curve of the entire 600 s interval after T 0 showing the main emission across the broad gamma-ray band including the shaded regions indicating the BTI: green indicates the LAT BTI, and the two gray areas, one partially overlapping the green area, are the GBM BTIs [(Lesage et al. 2023)](#b54). Yellow shows the intervals selected for joint spectral analysis of the triggering pulse, and of the prompt emission (numerical values in Tab. 3). In both figures, the LAT and the LLE light curves are also shown re-binned using these intervals (blue and red dashed line, respectively) while, in the last panel, the reconstructed event energy is displayed as a function of the arrival time. The GBM light curves (first three panels) are not corrected for the pulse pile-up effects.

the last interval, the value of β is compatible with the results for the COMP model. As a result of this comparison, we conclude that COMP is the preferred model for describing the triggering pulse.

We further divided the last two intervals based on the GBM count rate in order to track the parameters of the COMP model on a finer timescale. In the left panel of Fig. [3](#) we show the temporal evolution of the photon index and E peak over the GBM and LAT LLE light curves. The values are listed in Tab. 2. In the first figure of Sec. B we show the spectral fits for all time bins. The emission is very energetic in the first temporal bin with a very high E peak and a hard spectral index, and becomes softer at later times. The right panel of Fig. [3](#) shows the spectral evolution of the model. From T 0 + 19.95 to T 0 + 175 s, there is no detection of the GRB in either standard LAT nor LLE data, and therefore we derive a flux upper limit using standard LAT TRANSIENT 010E event class (Tab. 3).

## The Prompt Phase

During the prompt phase (from T 0 + 175 s to T 0 + 600 s) we used data from different detectors for different time intervals. From T 0 + 175 s to T 0 + 215.6 s and from T 0 + 280.6 s to T 0 + 435 s we used LLE data from 30 MeV to 100 MeV and TRANSIENT 010E above 100 MeV. We jointly  fitted them using unbinned likelihood for the standard LAT event class with ThreeML. During [T 0 + 215.6 s, T 0 + 280.6 s], corresponding to the BTI, we apply the analysis described in App. A. At T 0 + 435 s the GRB has a large incidence angle (∼80 • ), and, even if the pulse at T 0 + 510 s is clearly visible in the LLE event selection, the instrument responses are not well modeled, so we did not perform any spectral analysis. In each of these time windows, we divided and analyzed the data into several intervals. Fig. [4](#fig_2) shows the flux light curve in the 0.1 -100 GeV energy band and Tab. 3 lists the best model used (COMP or PL), the type of data used (GBM, LLE and standard LAT analysis), the numerical values for the energy flux, the estimated photon index Γ ph , and the value of the Test Statistic (TS). Since the TS is defined as -2 × (log(L 0 ) -log(L 1 )), with L 1 the value of the likelihood and L 0 the value of the likelihood when the source (in this case the GRB) is removed, it is only available when the null hypothesis is defined. This is the case for LAT-only analysis, for which we modeled the background components, and not in case of GBM-or LLE-only analysis, where background-subtracted data were analyzed.

## The Fermi LAT collaboration

The first GBM BTI ([T 0 + 219 s, T 0 + 277 s]) is similar to the LAT BTI. During this main part of the GRB prompt phase, the emission in the GBM energy range exhibits two very bright peaks at about T 0 + 230 s and T 0 + 260 s [(Lesage et al. 2023)](#b54), which is confirmed by the noise monitoring in the LAT instrument reported in App. A.2.1. The emission above ∼ 100 MeV, on the other hand, has only one peak, whose maximum occurred during [T 0 + 245 s, T 0 + 250 s], with a spectral index Γ ph = -1.6 ± 0.1. After this peak, the emission became softer (Γ ph ∼ -3) for 15 s and then, between T 0 + 270 s and T 0 + 435 s, the power law became quite hard again, compared to other Fermi -LAT GRBs, peaking at Γ ph = -1.6 ± 0.1 between T 0 + 325 s to T 0 + 355 s. This rapid variation of the spectral index during the prompt emission and the striking variability observed in the LAT flux, with multiple episodes up to 400 s after T 0 , is a new feature not observed in other LAT-detected GRBs, and clearly indicates the detection of the prompt emission at high energies.

The probability that an event is spatially and spectrally associated with the GRB was calculated following [Ajello et al. (2019)](#b15), by using gtsrcprob after running the un-binned likelihood analysis in each time bin. During the BTI, we only used events with energies > 1 GeV to limit the effect of the noise induced by low-energy events. Four events with reconstructed energy greater than 10 GeV and probability ∼ 1 were recorded by the LAT and are summarized in the first part of Tab. 4. The highest-energy event had an energy of 99 GeV, the highest photon energy recorded so far by the LAT during the prompt emission of a GRB. Measurement of the energies of these events, each of which was greater than 10 GeV, was unaffected by the extra noise in the calorimeter, for which the average energy deposition per event was < 100 MeV (see App. A.1.1 and Fig. [14](#fig_14)).

## Late Time Emission

For the late-time emission, we started our analysis at T 0 + 3917.6 s, when the GRB reentered the LAT field of view. First, we computed the exposure as a function of time. Considering that the typical decay time for GRB gamma-ray emission goes as T -1 , we multiplied the exposure by (T -T 0 ) -1 , providing us with a proxy for defining a temporal binning with an approximately constant number of expected events. Until T 0 + 40 ks we performed unbinned likelihood analysis with P8 TRANSIENT010E class events, while between T 0 + 40 ks and T 0 + 10 6 s, given the longer exposures, we switched to binned likelihood analysis using fermipy in ThreeML with P8 SOURCE class events, which has a lower contamination from misclassified cosmic rays. In each time bin, we included all the 4FGL [(Abdollahi et al. 2020](#b4)) sources with a predicted number of events > 1, estimated by using the photon flux above 100 MeV in the 4FGL catalog multiplied by the bin exposure (in cm 2 s). We left their normalizations free to vary[foot_7](#foot_7) . Three events with energies greater than 10 GeV arrived during this phase, as summarized in Tab. 4 and in Fig. [5](#fig_4). In particular, the LAT recorded an event with an energy of 400 GeV [(Xia et al. 2022)](#b87) arriving 33 ks after the GBM trigger. Its origin and association with GRB 221009A will be discussed in Sec. 4.7. The light curve for GRB 221009A is displayed in logarithmic scale in Fig. [5](#fig_4) with numerical values in the last part of Tab. 3.

To compute the onset time and the duration of the 100 MeV-100 GeV flux light curve, we used the same algorithm developed in [Ajello et al. (2019)](#b15): First, we calculated the probability for each photon to be associated with the GRB using the result of the likelihood analysis (using gtsrcprob). The onset time T LAT,0 corresponds to the time when the first photon with probability p > 0.9 to be associated with the GRB is detected, while T LAT,1 corresponds to the last photon with p > 0.9. T LAT,100   [2023](#)) with values reported on the right-hand vertical axis. The vertical red dashed lines correspond to the arrival times of the > 10 GeV photons while the green dashed line is the arrival time of the last event with probability > 0.9 to be associated with GRB 221009A. As in the previous figure, the shaded regions indicate the BTIs.

of the signal is simply T LAT,1 -T LAT,0 . To estimate the uncertainty on T LAT,1 (δT LAT,1 ) for an event with n detected photons with probability p > 0.9, we define ∆t n-1,n as the time interval between the second to last and the last event. Assuming Poisson statistics, the probability of measuring an event between t and t + dt is P (t, t + dt) = λ dt, where λ is the rate: in our case λ = 2/∆t n-1,n . Therefore, we conservatively compute the uncertainty as δT LAT,1 = 1/λ = ∆t n-1,n /2. Similarly, considering the first two events with probability p > 0.9, we define the uncertainty on T LAT,0 as δT LAT,0 = ∆t 1,2 /2. The error on T LAT,100 follows using standard error propagation. The arrival times of the first and last events of GRB 221009A with p > 0.9 are T LAT,0 =T 0 + 6.86 s and T LAT,1 =T 0 + 176673.012 s. The uncertainties estimated with the procedure described above, are δT LAT,0 = 106.22 s and δT LAT,1 = 2822.44 s, which lead to T LAT,100 = 176 ± 3 ks. The first event arrived during the triggering pulse. The second event associated with GRB 221009A arrived ∼200 seconds later, emphasizing the separate nature of the triggering pulse with the bulk of the GRB emission. The last events arrived more than two days after the GBM trigger, setting a new record on the duration of LAT-detected GRBs. The best fit model: f +f 1 +f 2 , bottom-right: f 0 +f 1 +f 2 +f 3 models including both afterglow emission and one, two or three pulses. In each panel, the gray band displays the 68% contour levels, obtained by sampling the posterior distribution. The cyan curve is the LHAASO-WCDA 300 GeV -5 TeV light curve [(Cao et al. 2023](#b29)). In the inset plots, the prompt emission (in linear y scale) is shown. The seven colored bands highlight the time intervals used in the combined Fermi GBM, Fermi LAT and LHAASO fit displayed in Fig. [8](#fig_8).

## DISCUSSION

The results presented in the previous section allow us to put some constraints on the modeling and to discuss possible scenarios responsible for the emission at high energies.

## Modeling the high-energy light curve

We modeled the 100 MeV-100 GeV energy flux light curve as the sum of multiple functions. First, we modeled the entire light curve with a smoothly broken power law (f 0 ) representing the typical forward shock emission for which we adopted the definition presented in [Nakar & Piran (2004)](#b60):

$f 0 (T) = K 1 2 T -T on τ -ξα 1 + 1 2 T -T on τ -ξα 2 -1 ξ ,(1)$where α 1 and α 2 are the values of the early and late time indexes, τ is a scale parameter and ξ defines how smooth the transition is. For our analysis, to limit the number of parameters, we fixed ξ = 2

$T p = τ - α 2 α 1 1 ξ(α 2 -α 1 )$.

After performing the fit with f 0 (T), we repeated the fit adding one, two or three pulses using the pulse shape described in [Norris et al. (2005)](#b64) and [Hakkila & Preece (2014)](#b45) with the following functional form:

$f i (T) = K i    exp T-T p,i τ i , for T < T p,i , exp T p,i -T ξ i τ i , for T > T p,i ,(3)$where τ i is the rise time of the i-th pulse and ξ i ̸ = 1 for asymmetric pulses. The best-fit parameters are summarized in Tab. 5 and the best-fit models are displayed in Fig. [6](#fig_5). The LHAASO-WCDA light curve [(Cao et al. 2023](#b29)) is also displayed (but is not used in the fitting procedure). The LAT light curve clearly shows multiple emission episodes and the preferred model fit (with the lowest value of the BIC) is the one with three components. A single emission episode described by f 0 fails to reproduce the complex behavior of the flux during the prompt emission, even if it is consistent with the flux observed at high energy by LHAASO-WCDA. In order to obtain a significantly better fit of the LAT data, two additional pulses are required, one describing the pulse at 350 s after the trigger, and another one describing the narrow feature observed during the BTI, at ∼250 s. Adding more pulses increases the BIC value (indicating that the increased complexity of the model is not justified).

## Internal Shocks vs External Shock

GRB 221009A is a complex burst in which multiple emission mechanisms from multiple radii from the central engine could be at play simultaneously. The nature of the late-time LAT emission during ∼ T 0 + 4 × 10 3 s -∼ T 0 + 3 × 10 5 s is similar to the extended emission detected by the LAT from other GRBs and the emission is due to the synchrotron process from an external forward shock (see, e.g., [Kumar & Barniol Duran 2009;](#b49)[Ghisellini et al. 2010;](#b41)[Ackermann et al. 2010;](#b6)[Razzaque 2010;](#b73)[Corsi et al. 2010)](#b31). The temporal decay of the flux during this time is F ν ∝ T -1.27±0.05 , or T -1.35±0.03 , depending on the model, which is between the flux decay F ν ∝ t -1 and F ν ∝ t -10/7 expected for an adiabatic blastwave and a radiative blastwave, respectively. However, an adiabatic blastwave is favored by previous LAT detections [(Ajello et al. 2019)](#b15). The onset time T 0 ranges from 213 ± 1 s to 214 ± 1 s, slightly before the onset time T * measured by LHAASO, while the peak T p of the afterglow from the onset time ranges from 23 ± 4 s to 17 ± 4 s, with the value for the best fit model being 18 +4  -3 s being consistent with the value derived by LHAASO for the 0.3-5 TeV light curve. The two emission episodes at T 0 + 330 s and T 0 + 250 s described by f 1 and f 2 , respectively, are very unlikely to have originated from the afterglow forward shock emission. Although we could not perform a detailed joint spectral analysis of the first pulse, basically due to the presence of BTIs in both the Fermi LAT and GBM, a detailed joint fit of GBM and LAT data is presented in Sec. 4.4, including information from LHAASO-WCDA, too.

Synchrotron emission from a reverse shock, with temporal flux decay F ν ∝ T -(73p+21)/96 for a thick shell and F ν ∝ T -(27p+7)/35 for a thin shell [(Kobayashi 2000)](#b48), can explain flux decaying as F ν ∝ T -2.1 only for p = 2.5 and is also very unlikely to produce exponentially decaying emission. Finally, even the high-latitude emission from a shell, a so called "naked GRB" [(Kumar & Panaitescu 2000)](#b50) with

$F ν ∝ T -(2-β) ∝ T -3$for the spectral index β = -1, is unable to produce this steep flux decay detected by the LAT. Therefore, the most natural explanation is that the LAT detected prompt emission from internal shocks until at least ∼ T 0 + 380 s. Our model suggests that during the prompt emission, the afterglow is subdominant the prompt emission, at least in the energy range below 100 GeV, while it becomes dominant at higher energies, in agreement with the LHAASO-WCDA light curve. A combination of shells ejected earlier in the burst with higher bulk Lorentz factors could initiate an afterglow even while shells with lower bulk Lorentz factors continue to produce prompt emission. Therefore, the afterglow onset time could lie between ∼ T 0 + 215 s, i.e. the beginning of the bright emission detected by the LAT, and ∼ T 0 + 600 s, when the afterglow-like feature was detected in X-rays by Konus-Wind [(Frederiks et al. 2023)](#b38). Using the values of the best fit model (f 0 +f 1 +f 2 ), the onset of f 0 (T on = 215 ± 2 s) and its peak (T p = 18 +4 -3 s) do indeed suggest that the afterglow peaks at early times. By identifying the peak time with the deceleration time of the afterglow, and using the kinetic energy E K from [Lesage et al. (2023)](#b54), we can derive the Lorentz factor, as in e.g. [Nappo et al. (2014)](#b61); [Ghirlanda et al. (2018)](#b40):

$Γ = 17 -4s 16π(4 -s) E K n 0 m p c 5-s 1 8-2s T p 1 + z -3-s 8-2s , (4$$)$where T p is the peak time in seconds, m p is the mass of a proton and c is the speed of light. We considered both a constant density Inter Stellar Medium (ISM) (s = 0) and a wind density profile (s = 2). For the first case, we assumed density n 0 = 1 cm -3 , while for the second case n(r) = n 0 r -2 with n 0 = 3.2×10 35 cm -1 . The derived values for Γ (wind) and Γ (ISM) are summarized in Tab.5. For the best-fit model, using T p = 18 +4 -3 , we obtained Γ = 250 ± 10 for the wind scenario (s = 2) and Γ = 520 ± 40 for the constant density ISM (s = 0). Assuming the derivation from [Sari & Piran (1999)](#b74) instead, also applied by [Cao et al. (2023)](#b29), we obtain their exact same value of Γ = 440. These values represent lower limits on the outflow Lorentz factor, which can be significantly higher for a relativistic reverse shock (i.e. a "thick shell", which is likely the case for this GRB).

The value of the BIC and its increase (or decrease) with respect to that with one less component is also shown.

To estimate the released energy of GRB 221009A, we integrated the best-fit model in time between the onset time T on and 300 ks. The last two rows of Tab. 5 show the values for each model. For the best-fit model, we obtained a fluence of (2.6 ± 0.4)×10 -3 erg cm -2 which corresponds to an isotropic energy E iso = (2 ± 0.3)×10 53 erg, both calculated between 100 MeV and 100 GeV.

## Estimation of the bulk Lorentz factor from pair opacity

The bulk Lorentz factor can be directly estimated by measuring the spectral cutoff in the highenergy band due to the pair opacity [(Vianello et al. 2018;](#b82)[Ajello et al. 2020;](#)[Arimoto et al. 2020)](#b19). We tested the presence of a spectral cutoff during the prompt phase by comparing the fit with a simple power law with one that has an additional exponential cutoff at high energies. We found that the model with a cutoff was not preferred in any of the time intervals; thus we can set a lower limit on the bulk Lorentz factor, Γ bulk,min :

$Γ bulk,min = 500 N 1 + z 1.151 -Γ ph L 0 6 × 10 52 erg s -1 99.3 GeV E max,obs 1+Γ ph -Γ ph 1.9 -5/3 0.1 s t v 1/(2-2Γ ph )$(5) where the luminosity L 0 = 4πd 2 L (1 + z) -Γ ph -2 F 0 , with d L the luminosity distance (in cm) and F 0 the energy flux in νF ν at 511 keV. N is a numerical parameter of the order of unity obtained from previous studies [(Vianello et al. 2018)](#b82), while E max,obs is the energy of the highest-energy photon, observed at T 0 + 240.3 s by the LAT (Tab. 4). In the interval containing this event [T 0 + 244 s, T 0 + 255 s] the LAT emission above 100 MeV can be well fitted by a single power-law function with a photon index of Γ ph = -1.9 ± 0.1 (see Tab. 3). For the minimum variability time scale t v , we cannot use LAT data because the intense flux of hard X-rays constitutes a major source of noise in every LAT subsystem (see App. A for details). Instead, we used t v ∼ 0.1 ms obtained from the GBM data [(Lesage et al. 2023)](#b54). To estimate the density of target photons at 511 keV, we first assumed that low-energy events and high-energy events come from the same physical place (so that the ∼MeV photons that we see are the same that could absorb the GeV events), and, using the results of the analysis presented in [Lesage et al. (2023)](#b54), we obtained a value of νF ν ∼ 10 -3 erg cm -2 s -1 , which implies Γ bulk,min ∼ 550. If instead we assume that the high-energy spectral component is separated from the low-energy spectral component, we can use the value of F 0 estimated by extrapolating the LAT power law to 511 keV, obtaining F 0 ∼ 10 -6 erg cm -2 s -1 and a value for Γ bulk,min = 170. The estimates of the bulk Γ obtained in this analysis are consistent with those obtained using the deceleration time scale (Sec. 4.2, Eq. 4, and Tab. 5) and, considering the uncertainties of the model, we cannot firmly establish if the preferred density is a constant ISM as opposed to a wind profile.

However, from the estimated bulk Lorentz factor, we can constrain the maximum synchrotron photon energy (with electrons shock accelerating over the Larmor time and then cooling over the synchrotron cooling time) under the assumption that the extended gamma-ray emission originates from the external forward shock. Fig. [7](#) shows the gamma-ray photons detected by the LAT compared with the predicted maximum synchrotron photon energy when using Γ = 250 for the wind case scenario and Γ = 520 for the ISM case, for both radiative and adiabatic expansion of the fireball. High-energy gamma rays detected by the LAT are in tension with the maximum synchrotron energy during both the prompt and afterglow phases, suggesting that their energies are boosted by inverse Compton scattering.

## Synchrotron, synchrotron self Compton?

To study the spectral evolution of GRB 221009A after the BTI, where the high-energy emission is prominent, we jointly fitted GBM[foot_8](#foot_8) , LLE and LAT data. We analyzed the time intervals after the first GBM BTI [T 0 + 280 s, T 0 + 435 s], using the same binning as in Tab. 3. In our analysis, we included detectors n7, n8 and b1, which all have a good viewing angle during the interval. In addition, LAT events (<99 GeV) LAT events (>99 GeV) Wind, Radiative ISM, Radiative Wind, Adiabatic ISM, Adiabatic

Figure [7](#). Observed LAT photons with > 90% probabilities of being associated with GRB 221009A. Red stars highlight events above 99 GeV. The lines show the highest possible energies for synchrotron photons based on the synchrotron shock model of the adiabatic/radiative expansion of a fireball in a circumburst medium with an ISM or wind profile, using the initial bulk Lorentz factors calculated from Eq. 4 and displayed in Tab. 5. Photons with energies above these lines exceed the maximum energy allowed by synchrotron emission. The gray shaded areas represent intervals in which GRB 221009A was not in the LAT field of view. Note that such intervals are not displayed for times greater than T 0 + 10 4 s.

we added LLE and LAT (TRANSIENT 010E) data using the ThreeML OGIPLike and FermiLATLike plugins. We also calculated the predicted intrinsic spectrum during the various time intervals from the LHAASO analysis to constrain the best-fit model. To this end, we used the best-fit model for the light curve N(t) described in [Cao et al. (2023)](#b29) (Fit [0,+∞), Table [S3](#) in the supplementary material), combined with equation S3 for the evolution of the spectral index Γ ph (t). For a set of 100 energy points from 300 GeV to 5 TeV, we computed the fluxes by randomly sampling the model parameters within their errors and integrating in time. The 15.9, and the 84.1 percentiles of the flux distribution define the 68% contour level. Finally, we used the ThreeML plugin XYLike that allows flux errors (assumed to be Gaussian) to be taken into account in the fit by computing the χ 2 relative to the assumed model. To find the model that best fits the data, we started from the same model adopted in [Ravasio et al. (2024)](#b72) for a similar time interval (SBPL). Similarly to [Ravasio et al. (2024)](#b72), we modeled the spectrum at low energy by adding a Gaussian line (G) with a peak free to vary between 1 MeV and 20 MeV, and a width between 1 MeV and 10 MeV. The decision whether to add the Gaussian feature was based on minimization of the residuals. At high energy, we also added an additional PL or a second smoothly broken power law SBPL to mimic the typical "two-hump" SSC spectrum. Given the increase in the number of parameters, we used the Bayesian inference analysis available in ThreeML to explore the parameter space, selecting multinest [(Feroz et al. 2009](#b36)) as a sampler. The combination of these components resulted in six different models, and we used the Bayesian evidence log Z to compare models[foot_9](#foot_9) . The decrease of log Z with respect to the best-fit model is shown in Tab. 6. The model with the highest value of log Z is SBPL+G+SBPL for every time interval. Nevertheless, according to Jeffreys' scale [(Jeffreys 1939](#b47)), the Gaussian line is strongly favored (∆ log Z > 5) only in the first five intervals, while there is only moderate evidence (2.5< ∆ log Z < 5) in the sixth interval, and no evidence in the last interval. With the same criterion, but now looking in Tab. 6 at the values of ∆ log Z in the SBPL+G+PL column, a break at high energies is always strongly favored. Fig. [8](#fig_8) shows the temporal evolution of the model. The Gaussian peak progressively shifts to lower energies with time, except in the last interval, although the Gaussian line is less significant. A break in the spectrum at ∼ 10 GeV is required to jointly fit LAT and LHAASO-WCDA data in each time bin. The extra component at high energy could be responsible for producing TeV photons, the detection of which within the first 500 seconds after the trigger was indeed reported by the LHAASO experiment [(Huang et al. 2022)](#b46). The required presence of the extra power law suggests that the high-energy gamma-ray emission is either SSC during the internal shocks or SSC during the external shock in the early phase of the afterglow. In App. B we summarize the results in every time bin for the LAT+GBM analysis, showing numerical values of the best-fit models (Tab. 9) and the residuals for the SBPL, SBPL+G and SBPL+G+PL models (figures in App. B).

Interval (s from T 0 ) SBPL SBPL+G SBPL+PL SBPL+G+PL SBPL+SBPL SBPL+G+SBPL  To answer this question, we need to put GRB 221009A in the context of other LAT GRBs, comparing some of its characteristics which those in the Second Fermi -LAT GRB Catalog 2FLGC (Ajello et al. 2019). Fig. [9](#fig_9) shows the fluence and luminosity as a function of time for GRB 221009A and for all the GRBs detected by the LAT that have known redshifts. We also highlight a few previous record holders: GRB 090510 is still the brightest short 11 GRB ever detected by the LAT, and still the one whose fluence peaks earliest. GRB 130427A was the previous record holder in terms of both fluence and highest-energy event, while GRB 190114C, also very bright, is the first detection announced at TeV energies. When comparing the two panels of Fig. [9](#fig_9), GRB 221009A is an outlier if we consider the fluence light curve, which has an extremely intense pulse lasting several hundred seconds during the prompt phase, as well as late-time emission being on the brightest side of the GRB distribution. On the other hand, if we take into account its distance the luminosity of GRB 221009A is comparable with other bright LAT-detected GRBs.

The estimated isotropic energy E iso can also be compared with that reported in the 2FLGC (Fig. [10](#), left). Given its proximity, GRB 221009A is surprisingly more energetic than other GRBs at similar redshifts, and it is as energetic as other GRBs at redshift > ∼ 2. Considering the difference in comoving volume confined within z = 0.151 and z > ∼ 2, this unequivocally demonstrates that GRB 221009A is an extremely rare event and will likely remain unparalleled in our lifetimes. The right panel of Fig. [10](#) shows the maximum photon energy recorded by the LAT for each GRB and its arrival time.

11 "Short" GRBs have a duration in the MeV energy range less than two seconds; the other ones are classified as "long". We have indicated both the highest energy events from GRB 221009A during the prompt emission as well as the 400 GeV event arriving 33 ks after T 0 . An interesting coincidence: for the previous record holder, GRB 130427A (redshift z = 0.34, [Levan et al. 2013](#b55)), the highest energy event was a 94 GeV photon arriving at 243.13 seconds after the trigger, almost exactly the same numbers as for the 99 GeV event from GRB 221009A. With respect to the population of LAT GRBs, the 400 GeV photon possibly associated with GRB 221009A clearly stands out. The association of this event with GRB 221009A will be discussed in detail in Sec. 4.7.

By two other measures GRB 221009A can be classified as the B.O.A.T: the fluence integrated over the entire emission and the estimated duration T LAT,100 . Fig. [11](#fig_11) shows the fluence from 0.1-100 GeV measured by the LAT as a function of the 10 keV-1 MeV fluence measured by the GBM (left panel), and as a function of T LAT,100 (right panel). The ratio of the 0.1-100 GeV to the 10 keV-1 MeV fluence is close to 0.1, compatible with the rest of the long GRB population. In the fluence-duration scatter plot, GRB 221009A clearly stands out as the longest (with T LAT,100 ∼ 1.8 × 10 5 s) and the brightest GRB yet observed by the LAT.

## Closure relation and density profile

During the temporally extended emission, the observed LAT photon index is Γ ph ∼ -2.2, while the observed temporal index α LAT = -1.2±0.1. Considering the spectral index β = -Γ ph -1, we can test the closure relations [(Tak et al. 2019)](#b77). In particular, for ν obs > ν c , with ν c the synchrotron cooling frequency, α = (3/2) Γ ph + 2 ∼ -1.3 for both the ISM case and the wind profile, which is compatible with α LAT . For ν obs < ν c , α = (3/2) (Γ ph + 1) ∼ -1.8 for the ISM case while α = (3/2) Γ ph + 1 ∼ -2.3 for the wind case, where both are in tension with the observed LAT photon index.

The derived spectral index from Swift-XRT in the 0.3-10 keV band from 1 ks to 6.3 ks from T 0 is Γ ph,XRT = -1.91 ± 0.09, while the combined Swift, MAXI and NICER light curve can be fitted with a broken power law with indices α 1,X = -1.498 ± 0.004 and α 2,X = -1.672 ± 0.008, with a break at . Left: Distribution of the isotropic equivalent energies (E iso ) as a function of redshift for the sample of Fermi -LAT detected GRBs. The red star highlights GRB 221009A. As in Fig. [9](#fig_9), we have highlighted the previous record holders with different marker colors. In terms of E iso , GRB 221009A is clearly an outlier among GRBs at z < 2. Right: Maximum photon energy vs. arrival time for LAT GRB photons normalized to the GRB T 95 , the total duration of the burst (dashed vertical line indicates unity). Blue circles/red filled circles are long/short GRBs, and green circles highlight LAT-detected GRBs that were outside the field of view at the time of the GBM trigger. For GRB 221009A we display both the highestenergy event during the prompt emission (at 99 GeV) and the highest-energy event during the temporally extended emission (at 400 GeV).

T = T 0 + (7.9 ± 1.1) × 10 4 s [(Williams et al. 2023)](#b85). For ν obs > ν c , both the ISM and wind scenario predict an expected decay index α = -0.85, and for ν obs < ν c α = -1.35 for the ISM case scenario and α = -1.85 for the wind case. As also noted by [Williams et al. (2023)](#b85), standard closure relations [(Racusin et al. 2009](#b70)) fail to reproduce the behavior of the X-ray afterglow emission, and the density profile cannot be firmly constrained.

## The 400 GeV event

The highest-energy event detected with a direction compatible with the location of GRB 221009A is a 400 GeV photon, which converted in the lower part of the tracker, where the thicker tungsten converter layers cause a slightly worst point-spread function (PSF). It arrived approximately 33 ks after the GBM trigger time. We performed a series of statistical tests of significance of this event 12 . First, we examined the LAT mission dataset from the beginning of the mission until the end of 2022, extracting all SOURCE events within a Region Of Interest (ROI) of 1 degree radius centered at the optical location of the GRB with energies >100 GeV. Tab. 7 shows the arrival time, the energy, the reconstructed direction, and the conversion type for each of these events, and Fig. [12](#) shows their arrival directions and times. The highest-energy event ever detected by LAT in this ROI is in fact the 400 GeV event arriving 9.3 hours after the GBM trigger. Comparing T off , the accumulated time 12 With "event" we mean the classification of the trigger as a gamma ray ). In both panels, GRB 221009A is marked with a blue star. UTC Energy R.A. Dec.

that the ROI was in the LAT field of view (approximately 4.2 years) and T in , the accumulated time from T 0 to the detection of the 400 GeV (approximately 3.8 hours), the probability p of observing N sig = 1 event above 100 GeV during the T in when N bkg = 5 events have been detected during T off is calculated using the method described in [Li & Ma (1983)](#b56) and corresponds to p = 1.6 × 10 -4 (3.6 σ). This probability is slightly lower (p = 4.0 × 10 -5 , or 3.9 σ) if we consider that only one event (N bkg = 1) is compatible with the 95% containment radius and it becomes p = 9.3 × 10 -6 (4.3 σ) considering that no other events at 400 GeV or above are consistent with GRB 221009A (N bkg → 0). Figure [12](#). Top: Arrival directions of all events with energies > 100 GeV within 1 • of the GRB location (green marker). The circles' radii are equal to the 95% containment PSF radius and their colors represent their energies. Bottom: Arrival times of these events (for precise arrival times see Tab. 7). The green dashed line corresponds to the Fermi -GBM trigger time.

On the assumption that the 400 GeV event indeed came from the GRB, we performed a second test to check if this event is compatible with the low-energy part of the spectrum. To do so, we repeated the spectral analysis between 27.81 ks and 51.09 ks, selecting this time only the events with energies < 100 GeV. The derived photon index is Γ ph = -2.5 ± 0.3. Then we computed the exposure above 400 GeV during the same time interval and assumed the spectral index Γ ph . The number of expected events N exp is given by the product of the integrated flux and the exposure.

The number of expected events above 400 GeV varies from N exp = 4.3 × 10 -6 to N exp = 5.8 × 10 -4 (at 68% confidence level) which corresponds to a probability ranging from 4.4 σ to 3.2 σ to observe at least one event.

If we lower the threshold to 360 GeV, which results from a 10% energy resolution at 400 GeV, the number of expected events above this threshold now ranges from N exp = 7.3×10 -6 to N exp = 1.0×10 -3 or probabilities from 4.3 σ to 3.1 σ.

Finally, a similar approach that allows us to take into account the uncertainty on the flux with its probability density function is to compute the upper bound of the flux, by increasing the confidence level c.l. until N exp = 1. The corresponding c.l. is 0.999970, or a probability of 3.1×10 -5 (4.0 σ) or a probability of 4.7×10 -5 (3.9 σ) for the lower energy threshold.

In summary, considering the entire Fermi mission elapsed time, the chance probability that an event above 100 GeV is detected within 33 ks after the GBM trigger, in spatial coincidence with the GRB is approximately 4 σ, indicating that we cannot firmly exclude that the photon is a background event. If the photon was indeed a background event, given the proximity to the Galactic plane and the absence of nearby point sources, it would likely be associated with diffuse emission from the Milky Way or from the unresolved population of blazars that constitute the majority of the extragalactic gamma-ray background [(Ackermann et al. 2016)](#b9).

On the other hand, if we assume that the 400 GeV event is indeed associated with the GRB, the probability that the event is generated from the high-energy extrapolation of the low-energy part of the spectrum is relatively low (between 3.1 and 4.4 σ), suggesting that this is unlikely to be the case. A preliminary HAWC upper limit (Ayala & HAWC Collaboration 2022) was calculated during a time interval that included the high-energy event, concluding that no bright emission was detected at TeV energies. A more in-depth analysis is currently underway and will help to assess the origin of this event.

Electromagnetic cascades from high-energy cosmic-ray interactions with the magnetic fields of the host galaxies or TeV photons interacting with the EBL could, in principle, explain such a delayed emission. In the latter scenario, the resulting electron-positron pairs would in turn interact with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) via the inverse Compton (IC) process, leading to a secondary cascade of multi-GeV photons, which could be delayed with respect to the GRB depending on the intergalactic magnetic field strength (see, e.g. [Neronov & Semikoz 2009)](#b63). As a first estimate, producing a 400 GeV cascade photon would require a ∼ 23 TeV primary photon assuming an equal distribution of energy among the pairs, while a 33 ks delay implies a ∼ 2×10 -18 G magnetic field. The exceptionally high energies reported by LHAASO would make this scenario feasible, but incompatible with intergalactic magnetic field limits derived from blazar observations (B > 3 × 10 -16 G for conservative blazar duty cycles; [Ackermann et al. 2018)](#b10). This tension could be alleviated if plasma instabilities in voids dominate particle cascade losses instead of IC, preventing persistent pair-beams induced by blazars from radiating at GeV energies [(Broderick et al. 2012)](#b26). However, having a cascade implies the presence of an additional component besides the afterglow. Estimates of these cascade components as produced by GRBs are highly uncertain and require a complete multi-wavelength characterization [(Da Vela et al. 2023)](#b32).

## SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

GRB 221009A is by far the brightest GRB ever detected by the LAT. In this analysis, we presented a comprehensive examination of this unique and intense burst.

The Fermi -GBM instrument was triggered by an initial pulse, which was also observable in LAT data. This triggering pulse was well fitted by a COMP model with a particularly high peak energy of ∼15 MeV, which decreased to roughly 300 keV within the first 20 seconds. The high-energy emission

The Fermi LAT collaboration observed by the LAT during the triggering pulse preceded the low-energy emission observed by the GBM, which is an uncommon feature in LAT-detected GRBs [(Ajello et al. 2019)](#b15).

During the prompt phase, we identified a 64-second-long BTI, [T 0 + 216.6 s, T 0 + 280.6 s], during which extremely high fluxes of X-rays and soft gamma rays created an additional noise in all the LAT subsystems. Thanks to a special analysis, including a dedicated event reconstruction and selection, we were able to successfully analyze the LAT data and derive the GRB light curve during the BTI.

During the first 450 seconds, the > 100 MeV flux was rapidly variable with several pulses closely spaced in time. We were able to clearly characterize the two brightest ones, the first peaking at T 0 + 247.4 ± 0.9 s and the second at T 0 + 330 ± 10 s, although other less-significant pulses are visible in the LAT light curve. The peak of the LAT emission is not synchronized with either of the two bright pulses at ∼ 230 s and ∼ 270 s in the GBM light curve. This can be explained by the rapid variability of the spectral index, a typical signature of internal shock emission. We performed a time-resolved spectral analysis after the LAT BTI, combining data from GBM, LAT and incorporating the results of the LHAASO-WCDA analysis. This study showed that a broken smoothly joined power law, which we interpreted as the synchrotron self-Compton component, is required to describe the high-energy part of the emission. The presence of a ∼10 MeV line was also statistically favored and, if associated with a blue-shifted electron-positron annihilation line [(Ravasio et al. 2024)](#b72), its evolution with time indicates a rapid deceleration of the jet, as suggested in [Zhang et al. (2024)](#b89). However, the relatively slow bulk Lorentz factor (Γ ∼ 5-10) needed to boost the 511 keV line to MeV energies, compared to the much larger value obtained from GeV and TeV observations, suggests that the emission line is probably related to a slower component of the jet or a slower-evolving shell, as also proposed by [Ravasio et al. (2024)](#b72).

Such a slow region could be envisaged as connecting to the familiar spine-sheath morphology of extragalactic radio jets emanating from supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Evidence for such lateral structure comes from limb-brightening of radio galaxy jets revealed in parsec scale VLBI observations (e.g., [Laing & Bridle 2002;](#b51)[Giroletti et al. 2004](#b43)). This has driven the paradigm (e.g., [Ghisellini et al. 2005](#b42)) of a mildly relativistic, outer jet, a dense sheath that carries most its kinetic energy and that entrains the external medium, surrounding a highly relativistic, lower density inner jet (spine) that possesses most of the jet's angular momentum. Both decelerate rapidly through the drag imposed by entrained circum-jet material. When such a configuration is employed in hydrodynamic simulations, with density ratios in the 10-100 range, the spine-sheath structure is preserved uninterrupted despite the generation of extensive turbulence in the shear layer between the two zones (e.g., [Meliani et al. 2008](#b59)). In the GRB context, bulk motions are on average much faster than for SMBH jets. The rate of pair annihilation would be much greater in a denser and slower periphery than in a more tenuous and faster spine, which is consistent with the disparity in bulk motions inferred for the line and from the pair creation transparency arguments in Sec. 4.3.

The late-time emission decayed as a power law, but extrapolation of the late-time emission during the first 450 s showed that this component, which is commonly associated with the afterglow, was only a sub-dominant component. This suggests that the afterglow began during the prompt emission. A fit of the light curve required multiple components, two of which were necessary to reproduce the general behavior during the prompt phase, and the third was needed to reproduce the late-time emission. This last component could peak as early as T 0 +230 s (rest frame), which corresponds to a deceleration time of 24 s. According to the standard fireball model, this corresponds to a bulk Lorentz factor of 230 (400) in the wind (ISM) case scenario. Under the assumption of radiative or adiabatic expansion, high-energy events observed by the LAT are incompatible with a synchrotron origin, as seen also in GRB 130427A [(Ackermann et al. 2014)](#b8) and in GRB 190114C [(Ajello et al. 2020)](#). In addition, the joint analysis of GBM and LAT data showed the presence of an additional component at high energies with a photon index Γ ph ranging from -1.7 to -1.4. This suggests that high-energy events were more likely to be related to this extra component identified as SSC, as also suggested by [Tavani et al. (2023)](#b78) from the analysis of AGILE data. In this scenario, the keV-MeV afterglow observed by the GBM up to ∼ 10 4 s would be the synchrotron emission, although whether this emission could extend up to ∼ 33 ks to explain the 400 GeV event detection is not clear. However, the absence of MeV synchrotron emission disfavors an interpretation of the late-time highenergy events as due to SSC. Additionally, interpreting these events as TeV electromagnetic cascades from TeV events interacting with the EBL is difficult because of the particularly low magnetic fields that would be required to explain the 33 ks delay. We cannot definitively say whether these events originate from external Compton emission or from another source.

Overall, GRB 221009A stands out compared to other LAT GRBs, and its energetic nature, given its proximity, confirms that it is extremely rare [(Burns et al. 2023b)](#). match the double-peak structure of the GBM light curve reported in [Lesage et al. (2023)](#b54). In the interpeak (IP) period, the extra energy reduces almost to 0, which means that the impact of the GRB LE flux during the IP period is very much reduced compared to P1 and P2.

Regarding the impact of the extra noise on the calorimeter reconstruction, it must be noted first that this impact is naturally mitigated by the clustering introduced in Pass 8. The calorimeter is much denser than the tracker, so the X rays and soft gamma rays deposit their energy over shorter distances. During the prompt phase, the -Y-face of the LAT[foot_10](#foot_10) faced the GRB and the noise-induced clusters are expected to lie close to the -Y edge of the calorimeter. This is what we observe, as can be seen in Fig. [14](#fig_14), for events with at least one track passing the trigger and gamma filter. During P1  Left: true energy median (dots) and 68% interval (vertical bars) as a function of log 10 E tkr for a simulation of a gamma-ray source with a spectral index of -2.5. The dashed line corresponds to equality between the true energy median and E tkr . Right: same but with a spectral index of -1.5. For E tkr < 100 MeV, the true energy median is almost constant and therefore E tkr can only be used above 100 MeV.

Because the first cluster energy information cannot be used during P1 and P2, we choose to rely only on the tracker information to estimate the event energies during the BTI. As described above, we use the number of fired strips within a cone around the event track axis to compute E tkr . In order to characterize the performance of this energy estimator and especially to check the energy range in which it is usable, we look at the true energy median and the true energy 68% containment interval as a function of E tkr . They are shown in Fig. [15](#fig_15) for a simulation of a power-law spectrum, for two spectral indices (-2.5 and -1.5). One can see that the E tkr energy estimator does rather poorly at low energies: the true energy median is almost constant for E tkr < 100 MeV and therefore E tkr can only be used above 100 MeV.

## A.1.2. Estimation of the trigger and on-board filter efficiency

In addition to creating extra noise in the tracker and the calorimeter, the GRB LE flux also produced signals in the ACD. Since the ACD is instrumental to the trigger and the on-board filter selection, we must check whether the extra noise in the ACD significantly changed the trigger and filter efficiency.

To be recorded, an incoming photon must trigger the LAT and pass the on-board gamma-ray filter. The LAT trigger system defines several sets of conditions which are called trigger engines [(Ackermann et al. 2012)](#b7). Two trigger engines are designed to accept gamma rays. Trigger engine 6 requires at least one calorimeter CsI crystal with more than 1 GeV, which corresponds to relatively high-energy gamma rays (∼ 5 GeV). Lower-energy gamma rays, which do not pass this condition, are accepted by trigger engine 7, which requires a trigger signal from one tracker tower and no signal above the veto threshold (∼ 0.45 of the signal of a minimum ionizing particle) in any of the ACD tiles above the tracker tower. The on-board gamma-ray filter performs a sequence of veto tests that depend on the event topology. An important case is trigger engine 7 events without any calorimeter CsI crystal collecting more than 100 MeV: one ACD tile above the veto threshold is enough to reject these events.

Verifying a selection efficiency implies comparing it with a reference. Very fortunately, the Earth limb came into the LAT field of view at about the time of the GBM trigger, providing a reference signal that we use to check the trigger and gamma filter efficiencies. The Earth-limb signal in the LAT depends on the position and orientation of the spacecraft. We have selected a reference data set including about 60 h 14 in which the satellite has a position/orientation very close to that between 100 and 1000 s after the GRB trigger. Using the reference data set, we prepared the live-time corrected zenith angle θ zen distribution for a set of bins in geocentric longitude and latitude (the longitude and latitude bin widths are 10 • and 0.5 • , respectively). Then, for a given time interval during the GRB emission, we construct the reference θ zen template by adding the θ zen distributions scaled by the live time in each of the geocentric longitude and latitude bins during the time interval.

For the verification of trigger and gamma filter efficiencies, we use trigger engine 7 events that passed the gamma filter, with at least one track and without any calorimeter CsI crystal collecting more than 100 MeV. The latter condition allows the selection to be sensitive to the presence of any ACD tile veto. To increase the significance of the Earth-limb signal, we also require that E tkr > 125 MeV. For each background hypothesis, the fit of the reference distribution allows us to derive the reference background template, as shown in Fig. [16](#fig_17) (left). The signal template is simply defined by subtracting the background template from the reference distribution.

For any time interval during the GRB emission, we fit the θ zen distribution with the sum of the background and signal templates, weighted by the free parameters of the fit, f b and f s , respectively. The relative efficiency with respect to normal conditions is directly given by f s . The result of the fit for the time interval [[600.6, 650.6](#)] is shown in Fig. [16](#fig_17) (right). For each background hypothesis, the fit gives f s and δf s , its uncertainty. To combine the results of the two background hypotheses, we use the minimum of f s -δf s and the maximum of f s + δf s of the two background hypotheses to define a 68% confidence interval, from which we derive the combined relative efficiency and its uncertainty.

To verify the method, we compute the relative efficiency for 50 s time intervals using several 900 s subsets of the reference data set. For each subset, we do not use the subset to build the reference template and the times are computed with respect to T ref , the time for which the satellite is at the same position/orientation as at the time of the GRB trigger. The results are shown in Fig. [17](#fig_18)  ∼ 1, which proves that, when taking into account the average shift of each subset, the uncertainty on the relative efficiency is correctly estimated. The relative efficiency for 50 s time intervals from 100 to 1000 s after the GBM trigger, except during the BTI, is shown in [Fig. 17 (right)](#). A fit by a constant gives an average of 0.97 and a reduced χ 2 of 1.

The results of the fit of the θ zen distributions for the time intervals [225.6 s, 235.6 s] and [245.6 s, 255.6 s], roughly corresponding to P1 and IP, are shown in Fig. [18](#fig_8). The Earth-limb peak is clearly visible for IP but not for P1, which is consistent with the derived relative efficiencies: 0.13 ± 0.12, 0.92 ± 0.10 for P1 and IP, respectively. We also note that the two θ zen distributions both peak at about 40 • , which corresponds to events coming from the GRB direction.

To derive the GRB light curve, we apply the same method to 5 s time intervals between 200 s and 300 s. The results are shown in Fig. [19](#fig_9) (left), for three log 10 E tkr thresholds. These results allow us to characterize the relative efficiency variation with time (especially the efficiency drop during P1), but the derived efficiencies are not very precise. Furthermore, they change significantly when increasing the energy threshold, which is not the case for the 50 s time intervals, as demonstrated by [Fig. 19 (right)](#). Another issue is that the efficiency during P1 is compatible with 0. Since there seems to be a GRB signal during P1, as suggested by the peak at approximately 40 • zenith angle in Fig. [18](#fig_8) (left), an efficiency compatible with 0 would not allow us to derive an upper limit of the GRB flux. To overcome this limitation, we develop an alternative method presented in the next section.  

## A.2. GRB flux measurement during the BTI

Measuring the GRB flux during the BTI requires an event selection and the estimation of its effective area. In the case of fast transient signals like GRBs, good sensitivity can be achieved with a minimal event selection. For the prompt emission of GRB 221009A, using a minimal event selection is actually recommended because it helps us to mitigate the systematics produced by the extra noise induced by the GRB LE emission. We choose the most simple event selection: Engine 7 events passing the gamma filter, with at least one track and above a given E tkr threshold, which will be defined later.

As explained in the previous Section, it is not possible to precisely estimate the event selection effective area with LAT data only. The only possibility is thus to use realistic simulations of individual HE photons on top of a background of LE photons. In order to do so, we need to know the GRB LE spectrum. This information is not provided by the GBM results due to the pulse pile-up effect during P1 and P2 [(Lesage et al. 2023)](#b54). In this section, we first describe how we constrain the GRB LE flux and we derive the event selection effective area as a function of time during the BTI. We then present the GRB light curve analysis.

## A.2.1. Characterization of the extra noise in the instrument

The photon absorption cross section strongly decreases with energy until it reaches a minimum at about 3 MeV, above which it is almost constant. So, the interaction of the GRB LE photons occurs very soon after the photons enter the LAT, while the interaction of HE photons occurs deeper in the instrument. Since the GRB is very far off-axis during the BTI (∼ 74 • with respect to boresight) and its direction is close to the y-axis, as shown in Fig. [20](#fig_20), the most exposed part of the tracker is the top planes of the -Y-face towers. That is the reason why we use the information of the two top planes of the two central towers of the -Y face of the LAT to monitor the extra noise level. We refer to this part of the tracker as the tracker corner. These two towers are highlighted in red in Fig. [20](#fig_20). We compute two quantities: N occ , the corner occupancy (the average of the fractions of events with at least one fired strip in the corner planes), and N mns the corner mean number of fired strips. Fig. [21](#) shows their variation, which makes apparent the features already seen in Fig. [13](#fig_13), namely P1, IP and P2. We note that, for individual HE photons, the expected levels of the corner occupancy and the mean number of fired strips are about 1% and 0.1, which is much lower than the levels reached during P1 and P2.

The average number of fired strips in the whole tracker could help us to characterize the extra noise, but it is likely biased by the signal induced by HE photons. To avoid this bias, we estimate the pedestal, that is to say the bottom edge, of this quantity, for any given time interval. To do so, we compute N 1% and N 20% , the 1% and 20% quantiles of the distribution of the total number of fired strips, and define N ped = (N 1% + N 20% )/2 and its uncertainty (N 20% -N 1% )/2. The P1, IP and P2 features are also clearly apparent in the variation of N ped , as can be seen in Fig. [21](#).

Figure [22](#) shows the same information as in Fig. [21](#), but with a y-axis range set to show the baselines of N occ , N mns and N ped .

The ACD information is less straightforward to use because its key role in the trigger and the on-board gamma-ray filter can very easily create a bias. We mitigate this problem by only using the information from the bottom tile of the -X face and the bottom tile of the -Y face. The four ACD bottom tiles (1.7 m long and 15 cm high, whose top parts cover the two bottom planes of the tracker) do not participate in the trigger decision and are not part of the most sensitive test of the gamma-ray filter. We use the -X and -Y bottom tiles and not the +X and +Y because the former face the GRB direction and their signals are thus not biased by the GRB HE emission. As in the tracker, the interaction of LE photons in the ACD depends on their energy. Using dedicated simulations, we find that the ratio of the signals in the -Y and -X bottom tiles is sensitive to the photon energy, as shown in [Fig. 23 (left)](#). So, this ratio is sensitive to the GRB LE spectrum. [Fig. 23 (right)](#) shows that this ratio does not vary much during the BTI, especially during P1 and P2. As a consequence, we assume that the shape of the GRB LE spectrum did not change significantly during the BTI.

This assumption allows us to use the tracker 1 s information during the BTI all together in order to constrain the LE spectrum. This is done by looking at the correlation of N occ with N mns and the correlation of N ped with N mns . These correlations, shown in Fig. [24](#fig_2), are both relatively tight, strengthening the assumption of a constant shape of the LE spectrum. As expected, the N occ correlation exhibits an inflection, while the N ped correlation is linear.

We model the GRB LE emission with a Band function [(Band et al. 1993)](#b24). It corresponds to two smoothly connected power laws and, in addition to its normalization, it is defined by E p , the SED peak energy, and α and β, the spectral indices below and above E p , respectively. For each set of parameters (E p , α, β), we perform multi-photon simulations, with photons between 0.1 and 30 MeV coming from the GRB direction, randomly distributed over a 2.8 m 2 surface, large enough to cover the entire LAT sensitive detectors. We can then predict N occ , N mns and N ped as a function of the incoming LE flux, as shown in Fig. [25](#fig_23) for (E p , α, β) = (0.6 MeV, -0.9, 2.9) and (1 MeV, 0.6, 5.0). These results are then used to predict the same correlations as measured in the data. For a given value of E p , we can perform a fit to the data to find the optimal values of (α, β). The fit for E p = 0.6 MeV gives (α, β) ∼ (-0.9, 2.9), providing a good data/prediction agreement as can be seen in Fig. [24](#fig_2). One can also see that α and β have to be changed by 0.3 to clearly see a deviation from the data.

We find a good data/prediction agreement for 0.4 MeV ≲ E p ≲ 1 MeV, with the following trend: β decreases when E p decreases. As will be shown in Sec. A.2.4, the HE power-law index during P1 and P2 is found to be ≲ 3. This constrains β to also be ≲ 3, which is reached for E p ∼ 0.6 MeV. The The black points correspond to (E p , α, β)=(0.6 MeV, -0.9, 2.9) and the red points correspond to (1 MeV, 0.6, 5.0). For a given LE spectrum hypothesis, these graphs can be used to estimate the LE noise flux (x-axis) from a measured quantity (y-axis). interval for E p thus shrinks to [0.6, 1 MeV]. The fit for E p = 1.0 MeV leads to (α, β) ∼ (0.6, 5.0), which also provides a good data/prediction agreement, as shown in Fig. [26](#fig_24). In order to assess the impact of the GRB LE flux, we will use in the following sections two hypotheses for the LE spectrum: B 0.6 = Band(0.6 MeV, -0.9, 2.9) and B 1.0 = Band(1 MeV, 0.6, 5.0).

## A.2.2. Event selection effective area

The event selection requires that a photon triggers the instrument, passes the gamma-ray filter, that at least one track is reconstructed, and that the reconstructed energy is above a given threshold. The corresponding effective area is estimated thanks to simulations of individual photons in the LAT.

Trigger engine 7 requires that the incoming photon triggers at least one tracker tower without vetoing any of the surrounding ACD tiles. Almost all photons below ∼ 1 GeV do not have more than 100 MeV in one calorimeter crystal and are thus rejected at the gamma-ray filter level by any vetoing ACD tile, which is a more stringent requirement than the Engine 7 ACD veto requirement. As a consequence we can divide the selection into the following three steps:

• the tracker tower trigger;

• the ACD veto by any tile above threshold;

• the track and energy requirements based on information provided by the event reconstruction.

The GRB LE flux impacts the event selection and we need to estimate the resulting correction factor, that is to say the ratio of the effective area in the presence of LE photon background with respect to the effective area without background. This correction factor depends on time (because of the time variation of the LE background flux) and we can factorize it into three parts:

$C sel (t) = C trig (t) × C veto (t) × C rec (t) (A1)$where C trig , C veto and C rec account for the three steps of the event selection. Since the LE background only adds activity in the instrument, it cannot prevent a HE photon from triggering a tracker tower, from which we conclude that C trig = 1 and that it can be ignored when estimating C sel . However, this trigger factor must be taken into account when estimating the false positive rate, as will be discussed in Sec. A.2.3. In the standard simulation of an individual photon in the LAT (like the one produced for the LLE analysis), all the energy deposits in the various parts of the instrument are assumed to occur at the same time. The situation is more complex when simulating one individual photon on top of a background of many photons because the background photons are not in-time with the signal photon. As a consequence, a realistic simulation has to take into account the characteristic readout times of the various detectors. For the tracker, the width of the trigger coincidence window is ∼ 700 ns, while the average time over threshold of the shaped signal is τ tkr ∼ 10 µs. For the ACD, our analysis depends only on the trigger fast signal, whose shaping time is τ ACD ∼ 0.4 µs. Rather than modifying the standard simulation to take into account these various characteristic times, we make use of the factorization of the effective area correction. Each part can be studied with a simulation performed with the number of LE photons that corresponds to the relevant characteristic time: τ ACD for C veto and τ tkr for C rec .

For a given time interval, the background LE flux is estimated using the tracker corner occupancy. Assuming a certain LE spectrum (either B 0.6 or B 1.0 ), we use the information of Fig. [25-(left)](#fig_23) to derive n tkr , the number of LE photons per m 2 in the simulation needed to reproduce the observed noise. Since the corner occupancy is based on the information of the fired strips recorded in the tracker, n tkr actually corresponds to the time window τ tkr . It means that we use a simulation with n tkr LE photons to assess C rec . To assess C veto for the same LE flux level, we use a simulation with a number of LE photons set to n ACD = r τ n tkr , where r τ = τ ACD /τ tkr , the ratio between the characteristic times of the ACD fast signal and the tracker readout signal, which is expected to be ∼ 0.04.

Because of the importance of r τ in the estimation of C veto , we want to constrain it with the help of the Earth-limb relative efficiency presented in Sec. A.1.2. This requires that we compute C veto and C rec both for HE photons coming from the GRB direction and for HE photons coming from the Earth-limb direction, which corresponds more or less to the mirror opposite of the GRB direction with respect to the plane y = 0. When estimating C rec , we are only interested in the effect of the LE background on the tracker reconstruction capability. Therefore, we perform simulations in which we ignore the energy deposited by the background LE photons in the ACD. C rec is given by the ratio of the selection efficiency with background compared to the efficiency without background. The selection threshold E tkr is set to 100 MeV for the GRB direction but we use 125 MeV for the Earth-limb direction in order to match the threshold used in Sec. A.1.2. We find that C rec does not vary significantly with energy for HE photons between 100 MeV and 1 GeV. The variations of C rec with n tkr are shown in Fig. [27](#fig_25). One can see that the GRB LE background impacts differently the HE photons of the GRB and Earth limb: the loss of efficiency at large n tkr is greater for the former.

We also use simulations to estimate C veto as a function of n ACD , the number of LE photons per m 2 within τ ACD . But in that case, the energy deposited by the background LE photons in the ACD is not ignored. As for C rec , we do not see any significant dependence on the HE photon energy. We neither see any significant difference between the GRB and Earth limb directions, as can be seen in Fig. [28](#fig_8).

For each hypothesis of the LE spectrum, we can estimate n tkr as a function of time from the corner occupancy shown in Fig. [21](#). In normal conditions, the corner occupancy is about 0.02 and we consider that no selection correction is needed when the corner occupancy is less than 0.035. n tkr allows us to know C rec (n tkr ). We then use r τ to compute C veto (r τ n trk ) and eventually get the selection correction factor as a function of time: where ϵ trig is the fraction of events that trigger a tracker tower, ϵ veto the fraction of events with a tracker tower trigger that are not vetoed by the ACD and ϵ rec the fraction of events for which a track is found and that pass the chosen energy threshold. The 1/τ trig term approximates the number of independent time intervals during which the background can trigger a tracker tower.

For an LE background flux given by n trk , we use simulations with τ trig /τ tkr × n trk to estimate ϵ trig . Regarding ϵ veto , we can assume that it is equal to C veto (r τ n trk ) because the tracker energy deposits and the ACD energy deposits are not correlated. ϵ rec is derived from simulations with n trk LE photons.

We use two values for τ trig , 700 ns and 1500 ns, and find no difference in false positive rate.

As expected, the false positive rate depends very much on β, the second spectral index of the LE spectrum. We actually find that for LE 1.0 with β = 5.0, it is always less than 1 Hz. On the contrary, the B 0.6 spectrum with β = 2.9 predicts a significant false positive rate, which can be considered as an upper limit. Fig. [31](#fig_27) breaks down the false positive rate in log 10 E tkr bins. One can see that it decreases very much with energy. As a consequence, we set the selection E trk threshold to 160 MeV to ensure that the false positive rate is less than 10 Hz. We note that, as can be seen in Fig. [15](#fig_15), a 160 MeV E trk threshold corresponds to about a 100 MeV threshold in true energy.

## A.2.4. BTI light curve

In order to determine the GRB HE energy flux for a given time interval, we perform a fit to the data with templates of the expected distribution of θ GRB , the angular separation with respect to the GRB direction. We used two kinds of templates: one to model the GRB HE signal and the other to model the HE background induced by the gamma-ray sky (including the Galactic diffuse emission and the isotropic emission). The former is predicted by the LLE simulation while the latter is estimated with data recorded between 0 and 180 s, that is to say before the GRB HE emission hits the LAT. The GRB HE emission is modeled with a power law with a spectral index Γ ph . Since the LLE simulation was produced with a spectral index of -1, it is weighted by E Γ ph +1 to predict the HE signal templates.

The fit is performed over 10 bins in log 10 E tkr between 2.2 and 3.2. There are two parameters for the HE emission (normalization and Γ ph ) and one background scaling parameter per energy bin. The results of the fit for the time interval [[245.6 s, 250.6 s]](#) are displayed in Fig. [32](#fig_28). For each time interval, we take into account the variation of the selection effective area during the BTI by computing the average C sel . We use the uncertainty on C sel to estimate the systematic uncertainty on the HE emission. To estimate n fp , the expected upper limit on the number of false positive events, for each time interval, we multiply the live time by the false positive rate of the first fit energy bin (2.2 < log 10 E tkr < 2.3). We then compare this number with n obs , the number of observed events within 20 • in the same energy bin. The correction factor that we use to account for the false positive rate (by multiplying the normalization of the HE signal) is therefore assumed to be in the interval [1 -n fp /n obs , 1].

We compute the light curve of the GRB HE emission during the BTI in 5 s time intervals. We find a significant HE emission after 215.6 s. The energy flux as well as the spectral index are shown in Fig. [33](#fig_29) and included in Tab. 3. The most striking result is that the HE emission exhibits a unique peak, occurring during IP, as discussed in Sec. 3.2. The spectrum during this peak is rather hard, with Γ ph = -1.63±0.09, whereas the spectral index during P1 and P2 is ∼ -3. After T 0 +275.6 s, the spectral index is about -2. We note that the template fit results after T 0 + 280.6 s are compatible with the results obtained with the LLE+TRANSIENT 010E joint fit with ThreeML and reported in Tab. 3.

## A.2.5. Conclusion

The GRB LE emission is so bright during a time interval of 64 s (BTI) that it is unfortunately not possible to perform a standard analysis of the LAT data. In this appendix, we have presented all the solutions and methods that we needed to develop in order to be able to analyse the LAT data and to eventually characterize the GRB HE emission during this BTI. Here is a summary of the main items:

• we replace the standard reconstructed energy with a new energy estimator, E tkr , based on the number of fired strips in a cone along the track axis;

• we use Earth-limb data to constrain the selection efficiency;

• we use the information in the top corner of the tracker and the information in the bottom ACD tiles to constrain the LE spectrum and precisely define the boundaries of the BTI;

• we perform simulations of individual HE photons on top of a background of LE photons to estimate the selection effective area as a function of time, as well as the false positive rate due to the LE background;

• we apply a template fit approach to derive the HE emission light curve.

The red triangles show the energy flux after subtraction of the contribution of the false positive maximum rate. For clarity's sake, the red triangles are only shown when the induced difference is greater than half the statistical uncertainty. Bottom: spectral index of the HE power-law spectrum. The blue points correspond to the results of the LLE+TRANSIENT 010E joint fit with ThreeML reported in Tab. 3.]()

We use the P8R3 TRANSIENT010E V3 instrument response functions.

In our analysis we used the 4FGL-DR3 release of the 4FGL catalog.

We used CSPEC (Continuous Spectroscopy) GBM data

In the statistical literature this term, which is the normalization integral on the right-hand-side of Bayes' theorem, is often called "marginal likelihood".

The Z-axis of the instrument reference frame corresponds to the LAT boresight.
