- **Higher-order structures**: Emergent organization in complex systems, characterized by synergistic information among interacting elements.
  
- **Research focus**: Shift from treating higher-order information as a dependent variable to using evolutionary optimization to evolve boolean networks with higher-order redundancies and synergies.

- **Boolean networks**: Directed graphs \( G = \{V, E\} \) where each node \( V_i \) can be in states {0, 1} and is updated based on the states of its parent nodes.

- **Key metrics**:
  - **Attractors**: Stable states that the system converges to.
  - **Average transient length**: Time taken to reach an attractor.
  - **Derrida coefficient**: Measures sensitivity to initial conditions.

- **Information integration capacity**: High-synergy systems exhibit chaotic behavior but high information integration; redundant systems are stable but have low integration capacity.

- **Tononi-Sporns-Edelman (TSE) complexity**: Balances integration and segregation, showing features of both chaotic and stable systems, with greater integration capacity than redundant systems.

- **Trade-off**: Fundamental trade-off between robustness of dynamics and capacity to integrate information, with certain complexities balancing this trade-off.

- **O-information**: Measure of redundancy and synergy in a multidimensional probability distribution \( X \):
  \[
  \Omega(X) = (2 - N)TC(X) + \sum_{i=1}^{N} TC(X_{-i})
  \]
  - \( TC(X) \): Total correlation defined as:
  \[
  TC(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} H(X_i) - H(X)
  \]

- **TSE complexity formula**:
  \[
  TSE(X) = N - 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{N} E[TC(X_\gamma)] |_\gamma = i
  \]

- **Intervention distribution**: Probability distribution on the states of the boolean network, initially set to maximum entropy, updated to reflect the state transitions after one timestep.

- **Applications**: Insights into emergent properties in various systems (e.g., brain dynamics, social networks, artificial neural networks) and implications for understanding system dynamics and designing complex systems.
