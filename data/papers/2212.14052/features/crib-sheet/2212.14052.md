- **State Space Models (SSMs)**: Achieve state-of-the-art performance in various domains but lag behind Transformers in language modeling due to expressivity gaps.
  
- **Expressivity Gap**: Identified through synthetic language tasks; SSMs struggle with recalling earlier tokens and comparing tokens across sequences.

- **H3 Layer (Hungry Hungry Hippo)**: A new SSM layer designed to address the expressivity gap by:
  - Stacking two SSMs with multiplicative interactions.
  - Utilizing shift and diagonal matrices to enhance token recall and comparison capabilities.
  - Matches attention on synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText.

- **Hybrid H3-Attention Model**: 
  - Combines H3 with two attention layers.
  - Outperforms Transformers by 1.0 PPL on OpenWebText.
  - Trained with 125M, 355M, 1.3B, and 2.7B parameters on the Pile dataset.

- **FlashConv**: 
  - A novel algorithm to improve SSM training efficiency on modern hardware.
  - Utilizes a fused block FFT algorithm for sequences up to 8K.
  - Introduces a state-passing algorithm to handle longer sequences efficiently.
  - Achieves 2× speedup on long-range arena benchmarks and allows hybrid models to generate text 2.4× faster than Transformers.

- **Performance Metrics**: 
  - H3 achieves lower perplexity than Transformers and excels in zero-and few-shot learning on SuperGLUE tasks.

- **State-Space Representation**: 
  - Continuous-time: \( \dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t), \quad y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t) \)
  - Discrete-time: \( x_i = Ax_{i-1} + Bu_i, \quad y_i = Cx_i + Du_i \)

- **Convolution Representation**: 
  - Output sequence can be expressed as a convolution of the input with a filter \( f \):
  \[
  f = [CB, CAB, CA^2B, \ldots, CA^{N-1}B]
  \]

- **Linear Attention**: 
  - Output computation: 
  \[
  O_i = \phi(Q_i) \sum_{j=1}^{N} \phi(K_j)V_j \bigg/ \sum_{j=1}^{N} \phi(K_j)
  \]

- **Key Insights for H3**:
  - **Shift Matrix**: \( A_{i,j} = 1 \) for \( i-1 = j \), enabling token logging.
  - **Diagonal Matrix**: Facilitates multiplicative interactions for token comparisons.

- **Training Efficiency**: 
  - FlashConv allows SSMs to scale to billion-parameter models while maintaining near-linear compute complexity.
