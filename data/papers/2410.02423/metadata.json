  "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce Plug-and-Play (PnP) Flow Matching, an algorithm\nfor solving imaging inverse problems. PnP methods leverage the strength of\npre-trained denoisers, often deep neural networks, by integrating them in\noptimization schemes. While they achieve state-of-the-art performance on\nvarious inverse problems in imaging, PnP approaches face inherent limitations\non more generative tasks like inpainting. On the other hand, generative models\nsuch as Flow Matching pushed the boundary in image sampling yet lack a clear\nmethod for efficient use in image restoration. We propose to combine the PnP\nframework with Flow Matching (FM) by defining a time-dependent denoiser using a\npre-trained FM model. Our algorithm alternates between gradient descent steps\non the data-fidelity term, reprojections onto the learned FM path, and\ndenoising. Notably, our method is computationally efficient and\nmemory-friendly, as it avoids backpropagation through ODEs and trace\ncomputations. We evaluate its performance on denoising, super-resolution,\ndeblurring, and inpainting tasks, demonstrating superior results compared to\nexisting PnP algorithms and Flow Matching based state-of-the-art methods.",
