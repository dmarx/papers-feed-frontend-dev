- **LEAPS Overview**: LEAPS is an algorithm for sampling from discrete distributions using a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) by learning a rate matrix.

- **Key Contributions**:
  - Combines annealed importance sampling and sequential Monte Carlo with learned measure transport.
  - Introduces Radon-Nikodym derivatives for reverse-time CTMCs to derive importance weights.
  - Proposes locally equivariant networks to parameterize rate matrices, enhancing scalability and minimizing variance of importance weights.

- **Target Distribution**: The target distribution \( \rho_1 \) is defined on a finite state space \( S \) with the probability mass function (pmf):
  \[
  \rho_1(x) = \frac{1}{Z_1} \exp(-U_1(x)), \quad (x \in S)
  \]
  where \( Z_1 \) is the normalization constant and \( U_1 \) is the potential function.

- **Time-Dependent pmf**: The time-dependent pmf \( \rho_t \) is given by:
  \[
  \rho_t(x) = \frac{1}{Z_t} \exp(-U_t(x)), \quad Z_t = \sum_{y \in S} \exp(-U_t(y))
  \]

- **CTMC Rate Matrix**: The rate matrix \( Q_t \) must satisfy:
  \[
  Q_t(y, x) \geq 0 \quad (y \neq x), \quad Q_t(x, x) = -\sum_{y \neq x} Q_t(y, x)
  \]

- **Kolmogorov Forward Equation (KFE)**: The KFE ensures that the distribution of walkers follows the prescribed path:
  \[
  \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \rho_t(x) = \sum_{y \in S} Q_t(x, y) \rho_t(y), \quad \rho_{t=0} = \rho_0
  \]

- **Proactive Importance Sampling**: The log-weights \( A_t \) are computed to re-weight the distribution of \( X_t \):
  \[
  A_t = \int_0^t K_s \rho_s(X_s) ds
  \]
  where \( K_t \) measures the violation from the KFE.

- **Radon-Nikodym Derivative**: The RND allows expressing expected values under different measures:
  \[
  \log \frac{dQ}{dP} = \log(\nu(X_t)) - \log(\mu(X_0)) + \int_0^t (Q'(s) - Q(s)) ds + \sum_{s, X_s \neq X_s^-} \log \frac{Q'(s)(X_s^-, X_s)}{Q(s)(X_s, X_s^-)}
  \]

- **Optimal Importance Sampling Condition**: The optimal IS weights have zero variance if:
  \[
  Q'_t(y, x) = Q_t(x, y) \frac{\rho_t(y)}{\rho_t(x)} \quad (y \neq x)
  \]

- **Final Importance Sampling Scheme**: The final scheme for sampling from \( \rho_1 \) is characterized by:
  \[
  E_{x \sim \rho_t}[h(x)] = \frac{E[\exp(A_t) h(X_t)]}{E[\exp(A_t)]}
  \]

- **Experimental Validation**: LEAPS is validated through simulations of the Ising model, demonstrating its efficacy in high dimensions.
