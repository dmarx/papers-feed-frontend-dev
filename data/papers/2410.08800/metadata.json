  "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the data preparation pipeline\ndeveloped for the OpenGPT-X project, a large-scale initiative aimed at creating\nopen and high-performance multilingual large language models (LLMs). The\nproject goal is to deliver models that cover all major European languages, with\na particular focus on real-world applications within the European Union. We\nexplain all data processing steps, starting with the data selection and\nrequirement definition to the preparation of the final datasets for model\ntraining. We distinguish between curated data and web data, as each of these\ncategories is handled by distinct pipelines, with curated data undergoing\nminimal filtering and web data requiring extensive filtering and deduplication.\nThis distinction guided the development of specialized algorithmic solutions\nfor both pipelines. In addition to describing the processing methodologies, we\nprovide an in-depth analysis of the datasets, increasing transparency and\nalignment with European data regulations. Finally, we share key insights and\nchallenges faced during the project, offering recommendations for future\nendeavors in large-scale multilingual data preparation for LLMs.",
