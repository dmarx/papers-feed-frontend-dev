- **Resource-Bounded Kolmogorov Complexity**: A necessary condition for the soficness of multidimensional shifts; relates to the ability to compress information within bounded computational resources.

- **Sofic Shifts Definition**: A shift \( S \) over an alphabet \( \Sigma \) is sofic if it can be represented as coordinate-wise projections of configurations from a shift of finite type (SFT) \( S' \) via a mapping \( \pi: \Sigma \to \Sigma \).

- **Key Classes of Shifts**:
  - **Shifts of Finite Type (SFT)**: Defined by a finite set of forbidden patterns.
  - **Sofic Shifts**: Defined by a regular language of forbidden patterns.
  - **Effective Shifts**: Defined by a computable set of forbidden patterns.

- **Equivalence in Sofic Shifts**: Two words \( w_1, w_2 \) are equivalent in a shift \( S \) if they have the same follower sets, implying that the finite patterns in \( S \) can be grouped into a finite number of equivalence classes.

- **Multidimensional Shifts**: Extends the concept of shifts to \( \mathbb{Z}^d \) for \( d > 1 \), maintaining definitions of effective shifts, SFTs, and sofic shifts.

- **Examples of Non-Sofic Shifts**:
  - **Mirror Shift**: Configurations are symmetric about a horizontal line; requires transmitting information across a contour, leading to non-soficness due to insufficient information flow.
  - **High Complexity Shift**: All binary configurations where the Kolmogorov complexity \( C(P) = \Omega(n^2) \) for \( n \times n \) patterns, indicating that no pattern can be produced by a program smaller than a quadratic size.

- **Information Flow Argument**: Non-soficness can be shown by demonstrating that essential information in a pattern cannot be compressed to size \( O(n) \) in bounded time, contradicting the properties of sofic shifts.

- **Extender Sets**: Generalization of follower sets for multidimensional shifts; the number of different extender sets \( N_k \) for globally admissible patterns of size \( k \times k \) can indicate information flow across the pattern's border.

- **Non-Soficness Conditions**: Non-sofic shifts can have low block complexity, with the number of globally admissible patterns growing polynomially rather than exponentially.

- **Pumping Lemma**: Traditional proofs of non-soficness often utilize a version of the pumping lemma from automata theory, which may not apply directly to multidimensional shifts.

- **Compression and Information Flow**: The paper emphasizes the importance of understanding how information can be compressed and transmitted across patterns in proving non-soficness, particularly in the context of multidimensional shifts.
