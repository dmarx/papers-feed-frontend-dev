The paper you provided discusses the intricate relationship between resource-bounded Kolmogorov complexity and the soficness of multidimensional shifts in symbolic dynamics. Below, I will provide detailed technical explanations and justifications for the researchers' decisions regarding various aspects of their study.

### 1. Definition of Resource-Bounded Kolmogorov Complexity in the Context of Shifts
The researchers chose to define resource-bounded Kolmogorov complexity to analyze the limitations of information transmission in shifts. This definition allows them to quantify how much information can be effectively communicated across the boundaries of patterns in a shift. By focusing on resource-bounded complexity, they can establish necessary conditions for soficness, as it highlights the constraints imposed by computational resources on the ability to compress and transmit information.

### 2. Criteria for Soficness in Multidimensional Shifts
The criteria for soficness in multidimensional shifts were established to extend the one-dimensional definitions to higher dimensions. The researchers aimed to maintain consistency with existing definitions while addressing the unique challenges posed by multidimensional configurations. By defining sofic shifts as coordinate-wise projections of shifts of finite type (SFTs), they ensure that the properties of soficness are preserved in a way that is meaningful in higher dimensions.

### 3. Choice of Examples for Effective and Non-Sofic Shifts
The selection of specific examples, such as the mirror shift and the high complexity shift, serves to illustrate the theoretical concepts discussed in the paper. These examples were chosen because they are well-known in the literature and provide clear cases of effective shifts that are not sofic. By using these examples, the researchers can effectively demonstrate their new techniques and the implications of their findings.

### 4. Use of Algorithmic Descriptive Complexity in Proving Non-Soficness
The researchers employed algorithmic descriptive complexity to formalize the intuition behind information flows in shifts. This approach allows them to rigorously prove non-soficness by showing that the essential information contained in patterns cannot be compressed within the bounds of polynomial complexity. This method provides a robust framework for understanding the limitations of sofic shifts in terms of information transmission.

### 5. Methodology for Analyzing Information Flow in Shifts
The methodology for analyzing information flow involves examining how information is transmitted across the boundaries of patterns. The researchers argue that in sofic shifts, the amount of information that can flow across a contour is limited, which leads to contradictions when attempting to establish non-soficness. This analysis is crucial for understanding the structural properties of shifts and their classifications.

### 6. Decision to Focus on Polynomial Block Complexity in Examples
Focusing on polynomial block complexity allows the researchers to explore shifts that exhibit low complexity while still being non-sofic. This choice emphasizes that non-soficness is not solely determined by high complexity but can also arise in cases where the growth of globally admissible patterns is polynomial. This insight broadens the understanding of the relationship between complexity and soficness.

### 7. Approach to Defining Extender Sets for Multidimensional Shifts
The definition of extender sets as a generalization of follower sets is a strategic choice that enables the researchers to analyze the relationships between patterns in multidimensional shifts. By focusing on the structure of these sets, they can derive insights into the information flow and consistency requirements that govern the behavior of shifts, which is essential for proving non-soficness.

### 8. Selection of Forbidden Patterns for Defining Shifts
The choice of forbidden patterns is critical in defining shifts, as they directly influence the properties of the shift space. The researchers emphasize that different sets of forbidden patterns can induce the same shift, which highlights the flexibility in constructing shifts while maintaining their essential characteristics. This choice allows for a more nuanced exploration of the relationships between different classes of shifts.

### 9. Justification for the Distinction Between Effective, Sofic, and SFTs
The distinction between effective shifts, sofic shifts, and shifts of finite type (SFTs) is justified by their differing properties and implications in symbolic dynamics. By clearly delineating these classes, the researchers can better understand the limitations and capabilities of each type of shift, which is essential for their analysis of non-soficness.

### 10. Framework for Discussing Necessary Conditions for Soficness
The framework established for discussing necessary conditions for soficness is designed to provide a systematic approach to understanding the implications of resource-bounded complexity. This framework allows the researchers to derive general principles that can be applied to various shifts, facilitating a deeper understanding of the conditions under which soficness holds.

### 11. Techniques for Proving Non-Soficness Using Pumping Lemma Variations
The use of variations of the pumping lemma from automata theory provides a familiar and established method for proving non-soficness. By adapting these techniques to the context of multidimensional shifts, the researchers can leverage existing knowledge while contributing new insights into the nature of non-sofic shifts.
