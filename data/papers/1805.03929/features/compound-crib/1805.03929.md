The paper you provided discusses the intricate relationship between resource-bounded Kolmogorov complexity and the soficness of multidimensional shifts in symbolic dynamics. Below, I will elaborate on the technical explanations and justifications for the researchers' decisions regarding the various concepts mentioned.

### Resource-Bounded Kolmogorov Complexity

**Justification**: The introduction of resource-bounded Kolmogorov complexity as a necessary condition for the soficness of multidimensional shifts is pivotal. Traditional Kolmogorov complexity measures the complexity of a string based on the length of the shortest program that can generate it. However, in practical scenarios, computational resources (time and space) are limited. By focusing on resource-bounded complexity, the researchers can analyze how much information can be effectively compressed and transmitted within these constraints. This is crucial for understanding the limitations of sofic shifts, which require that information can be represented in a way that adheres to finite computational resources.

### Sofic Shifts Definition

**Justification**: The definition of sofic shifts as coordinate-wise projections of configurations from a shift of finite type (SFT) is essential for establishing a clear framework for analyzing shifts. This definition allows for a structured approach to understanding how complex patterns can be derived from simpler ones. The mapping \( \pi: \Sigma \to \Sigma \) serves as a bridge between the more complex SFTs and the potentially simpler sofic shifts, facilitating the exploration of their properties and relationships.

### Key Classes of Shifts

**Justification**: The classification of shifts into SFTs, sofic shifts, and effective shifts provides a foundational understanding of the landscape of symbolic dynamics. Each class has distinct characteristics that influence their behavior and properties. For instance, SFTs are defined by a finite set of forbidden patterns, making them more restrictive, while sofic shifts allow for a broader range of configurations through regular languages. Effective shifts introduce computability into the mix, highlighting the importance of algorithmic processes in defining shift spaces. This classification is crucial for the subsequent analysis of non-sofic shifts.

### Equivalence in Sofic Shifts

**Justification**: The concept of equivalence in sofic shifts, where two words are considered equivalent if they have the same follower sets, is significant for understanding the structure of these shifts. This equivalence implies that the finite patterns can be grouped into a finite number of classes, which simplifies the analysis of the shift's properties. It also underscores the idea that sofic shifts can be characterized by a limited amount of information, which is a key aspect of their definition.

### Multidimensional Shifts

**Justification**: Extending the concept of shifts to multidimensional spaces (i.e., \( \mathbb{Z}^d \) for \( d > 1 \)) is a natural progression in the study of symbolic dynamics. This extension allows researchers to explore more complex interactions and configurations that arise in higher dimensions. The definitions of effective shifts, SFTs, and sofic shifts remain applicable, but the nuances of multidimensionality introduce new challenges and opportunities for analysis.

### Examples of Non-Sofic Shifts

**Justification**: The inclusion of specific examples, such as the mirror shift and high complexity shift, serves to illustrate the theoretical concepts in a concrete manner. These examples highlight the limitations of sofic shifts in capturing certain types of information flow and complexity. The mirror shift demonstrates how symmetry can lead to non-soficness due to the need for extensive information transmission across borders, while the high complexity shift emphasizes the relationship between Kolmogorov complexity and the inability to represent certain patterns within the constraints of sofic shifts.

### Information Flow Argument

**Justification**: The argument regarding information flow is central to the paper's thesis. By demonstrating that essential information in a pattern cannot be compressed to size \( O(n) \) in bounded time, the researchers provide a compelling rationale for the non-soficness of certain shifts. This argument aligns with the broader theme of the paper, which emphasizes the importance of understanding how information is transmitted and represented within the constraints of computational resources.

### Extender Sets

**Justification**: The introduction of extender sets as a generalization of follower sets for multidimensional shifts is a novel approach that enriches the analysis of information flow. By examining the number of different extender sets for globally admissible patterns, the researchers can gain insights into the complexity of the shift and the nature of information transmission across patterns. This concept is particularly relevant in the context of multidimensional shifts, where the interactions between patterns can be more intricate.

### Non-Soficness Conditions

**Justification**: The identification of conditions under which shifts are non-sofic, particularly in relation to block complexity, is crucial for understanding the limitations of sofic shifts. By showing that non-sofic shifts can exhibit low block complexity, the researchers challenge the conventional wisdom that high complexity is a prerequisite for non-soficness. This insight broadens the scope of potential non-sofic shifts and encourages further exploration of their properties.
