  "abstract": "When you have a question, the most effective way to have the question\nanswered is to directly connect with experts on the topic and have a\nconversation with them. Prior to the invention of writing, this was the only\nway. Although effective, this solution exhibits scalability challenges. Writing\nallowed knowledge to be materialized, preserved, and replicated, enabling the\ndevelopment of different technologies over the centuries to connect information\nseekers with relevant information. This progression ultimately culminated in\nthe ten-blue-links web search paradigm we're familiar with, just before the\nrecent emergence of generative AI. However, we often forget that consuming\nstatic content is an imperfect solution. With the advent of large language\nmodels, it has become possible to develop a superior experience by allowing\nusers to directly engage with experts. These interactions can of course satisfy\ninformation needs, but expert models can do so much more. This coming future\nrequires reimagining search.",
