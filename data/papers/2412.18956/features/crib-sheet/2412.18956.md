- **Core Hypothesis**: The future of search should return to direct expert engagement, enhanced by large language models (LLMs) to overcome scalability challenges.
  
- **Historical Context**: Preliterate societies relied on direct conversations with experts for information seeking; writing emerged ~5000 years ago, enabling knowledge materialization.

- **Scalability Challenges**:
  - **Bandwidth Limitation**: Experts can only engage in a limited number of conversations daily due to other responsibilities.
  - **Finding Experts**: As populations grow, identifying and accessing relevant experts becomes increasingly difficult (Dunbar's number).

- **Materialization of Knowledge**: Writing allowed knowledge to be preserved and replicated, solving the bandwidth issue and enabling wider dissemination.

- **Sub-optimal User Experience**: Static content (books, articles) limits interaction; users cannot engage in follow-up discussions or clarifications.

- **Search Evolution**: Traditional search engines connect users to materialized proxies of knowledge (e.g., webpages), but do not facilitate direct expert interaction.

- **LLMs as Expert Avatars**: Future interactions may involve conversing with LLMs representing experts, providing a more dynamic and personalized experience.

- **Economic Viability of LLMs**: The marginal cost of replicating LLMs is decreasing (estimated 10Ã— reduction per year), leading to a proliferation of specialized models.

- **Reimagining Search**: The concept of search must evolve from finding documents to facilitating interactions with LLM experts capable of performing tasks (e.g., composing poetry, providing tailored advice).

- **Outcome of Information Seeking**: The ultimate goal of information seeking is often action-oriented, where LLMs can assist directly in fulfilling user needs beyond mere information retrieval.

- **Future Considerations**: The search paradigm must adapt to a landscape with millions of LLMs, focusing on finding the right assistant for user wants rather than just information.
