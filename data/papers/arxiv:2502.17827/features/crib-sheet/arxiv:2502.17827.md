- **Model Overview**: The DPGLM is a semiparametric Bayesian extension of the SPGLM, incorporating a varying weight dependent Dirichlet process (DDP) model to define a nonparametric baseline distribution.

- **Key Equations**:
  - GLM formulation: \( p_x(y) \equiv p(y | x) \propto \exp(\theta_x y) \mu(y) \)
  - Normalization constant: \( b(\theta_x) = \log \int_Y \exp(\theta_x y) \mu(dy) \)
  - Linear predictor: \( \eta = x^T \beta \) and link function \( g \) such that \( \lambda(x) = E(y | x) = g^{-1}(\eta) \)

- **Nonparametric Baseline**: The baseline distribution \( f_\mu \) is treated as an unknown parameter, allowing for greater flexibility compared to classical GLMs.

- **Dirichlet Process (DP)**: The DP prior is characterized by concentration parameter \( \alpha \) and base distribution \( G_0 \), with representation:
  \[
  G(\cdot) \equiv \sum_{h=1}^{\infty} s_h \delta_{z_h}(\cdot)
  \]
  where \( s_h = v_h \prod_{\ell<h}(1 - v_\ell) \) and \( v_h \sim \text{Be}(1, \alpha) \).

- **Normalized Random Measures (NRM)**: The model utilizes NRMs, defined as \( \mu/\mu(Y) \), where \( \mu \) is a completely random measure.

- **LÃ©vy Intensity**: For the implied marginal distribution \( G_x(z) \):
  \[
  \nu(ds, dz) = \frac{1}{s} e^{-s} \exp(-\theta_x z) ds \cdot \alpha G_0(dz)
  \]
  characterizing the inhomogeneous NRM.

- **Posterior Simulation**: The model allows for straightforward posterior simulation using methods developed for mixtures with normalized random measures.

- **Identifiability**: The model's parameters \( \mu \) and \( \theta_x \) can be transformed without affecting the likelihood, necessitating post-processing to ensure meaningful inference.

- **Simulation Studies**: Validation of the model is conducted through simulation studies, demonstrating its applicability and robustness.

- **Application Example**: The methodology is illustrated using data from a speech intelligibility study, showcasing its practical utility.
