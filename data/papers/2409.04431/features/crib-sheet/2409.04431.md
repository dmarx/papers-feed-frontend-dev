- **Sigmoid Attention Overview**: Sigmoid attention (SigmoidAttn) replaces softmax in transformers, defined as:
  \[
  \text{SigmoidAttn}(X) = \sigma\left(\frac{QK^T}{d_{qk}}\right)V
  \]
  where \(\sigma(u) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(u+b)}}\) and \(b = \log(n)\).

- **Universal Approximation Property (UAP)**: SigmoidAttn retains UAP, allowing it to approximate any continuous, permutation-equivariant function \(f\) with arbitrary precision:
  \[
  \|f(X) - g(X)\|_{p} \leq \epsilon
  \]
  for \(1 \leq p < \infty\).

- **Regularity of Sigmoid Attention**: The Lipschitz constant for SigmoidAttn is bounded, indicating robustness and ease of optimization:
  \[
  \|W_v\|_2 \sigma_\infty + 2\sigma'_\infty \|W_q^T W_k\|_2 \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \|x_i\|_2^2
  \]

- **Comparison with Softmax Attention**: SigmoidAttn shows improved regularity, with lower local Lipschitz constants compared to SoftmaxAttn, which can lead to instability during training.

- **FLASH-SIGMOID Implementation**: A hardware-aware implementation yielding a 17% speed-up over FLASHATTENTION2, utilizing:
  - **Tiling**: Processes input in blocks for efficient computation.
  - **Kernel Fusion**: Combines forward and backward passes into single GPU kernels.
  - **Activation Recomputation**: Retains only necessary tensors to optimize memory usage during backward pass.

- **Empirical Performance**: SigmoidAttn matches or outperforms SoftmaxAttn across various tasks in language, vision, and speech domains.

- **Multi-Head Attention**: The multi-head version of SigmoidAttn is defined as:
  \[
  [\text{SigmoidAttn}_1(X), \ldots, \text{SigmoidAttn}_h(X)] W_o
  \]
  where \(W_o\) is a learnable output weight matrix.

- **Attention Weight Normalization**: The choice of bias \(b = \log(n)\) helps stabilize attention weights, ensuring effective learning even with large input sequences.

- **Computational Complexity**: The difference in floating operations between Sigmoid and Softmax is minimal (~1%), but Sigmoid's implementation can lead to significant speed improvements due to reduced memory access overhead.

- **Theoretical Contributions**: The paper provides proofs and bounds for the properties of SigmoidAttn, establishing it as a viable alternative to Softmax in transformer architectures.
