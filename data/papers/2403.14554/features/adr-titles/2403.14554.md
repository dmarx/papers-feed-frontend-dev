- Decision to use a hybrid representation of 3D scenes with Gaussian Frosting
- Choice of Gaussian Splatting as the foundational method for initialization
- Adoption of SuGaR for mesh extraction and Gaussian alignment
- Implementation of adaptive thickness for the Frosting layer
- Strategy for populating the Frosting layer with Gaussians
- Method for real-time parameter adjustment of Gaussians during animation
- Selection of RGB images as the sole input for building the representation
- Decision to prioritize rendering quality for fuzzy materials over strict mesh alignment
- Approach to defining inner and outer bounds for the Frosting layer
- Use of a rendering loss combining pixel-wise L1 distance and D-SSIM for optimization
- Choice to release code and a browser-based viewer as part of the project contribution
- Decision to improve hyperparameter tuning for mesh extraction from SuGaR
- Strategy for identifying areas needing more volumetric rendering based on Gaussian misalignment
- Decision to focus on real-time rendering capabilities in the design
- Choice to allow traditional animation tools for scene manipulation
