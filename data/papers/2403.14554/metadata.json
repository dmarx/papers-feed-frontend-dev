  "title": "Gaussian Frosting: Editable Complex Radiance Fields with Real-Time\n  Rendering",
  "authors": "Antoine Gu\u00e9don, Vincent Lepetit",
  "abstract": "We propose Gaussian Frosting, a novel mesh-based representation for\nhigh-quality rendering and editing of complex 3D effects in real-time. Our\napproach builds on the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, which optimizes\na set of 3D Gaussians to approximate a radiance field from images. We propose\nfirst extracting a base mesh from Gaussians during optimization, then building\nand refining an adaptive layer of Gaussians with a variable thickness around\nthe mesh to better capture the fine details and volumetric effects near the\nsurface, such as hair or grass. We call this layer Gaussian Frosting, as it\nresembles a coating of frosting on a cake. The fuzzier the material, the\nthicker the frosting. We also introduce a parameterization of the Gaussians to\nenforce them to stay inside the frosting layer and automatically adjust their\nparameters when deforming, rescaling, editing or animating the mesh. Our\nrepresentation allows for efficient rendering using Gaussian splatting, as well\nas editing and animation by modifying the base mesh. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method on various synthetic and real scenes, and show that\nit outperforms existing surface-based approaches. We will release our code and\na web-based viewer as additional contributions. Our project page is the\nfollowing: https://anttwo.github.io/frosting/",
