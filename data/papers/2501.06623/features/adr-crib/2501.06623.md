The proposal to utilize buried nuclear explosions for carbon sequestration through Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW) is a complex and controversial approach that raises numerous technical, environmental, political, and economic considerations. Below is a detailed examination of the rationale behind each of the key decisions made by the researchers in this proposal.

### 1. Decision to Utilize Buried Nuclear Explosions for Carbon Sequestration
**Rationale:** The primary motivation for using buried nuclear explosions is the need for a large-scale, efficient method to fracture and pulverize vast quantities of basalt rock, which is essential for ERW. Traditional methods of mining and crushing basalt are energy-intensive and logistically challenging. Nuclear explosions can provide the necessary energy to break apart large volumes of rock quickly and effectively, potentially achieving the scale required for meaningful carbon sequestration.

### 2. Choice of Basaltic Seabed as the Target for Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW)
**Rationale:** Basalt is chosen due to its high mineral content, which is effective in reacting with CO2 to form stable carbonates. The seabed is selected to minimize ecological disruption and to leverage the natural processes of ocean currents to distribute the pulverized basalt, enhancing the weathering process. Additionally, basaltic formations are abundant in certain oceanic regions, making them suitable targets for this intervention.

### 3. Assumption of a Gigaton Yield Requirement for Effective Carbon Sequestration
**Rationale:** The researchers assume a gigaton yield is necessary based on the scale of global CO2 emissions and the amount of basalt required to sequester significant quantities of carbon. Given that approximately 36 gigatons of CO2 are emitted annually, a substantial yield is needed to sequester decades' worth of emissions effectively. This assumption is grounded in the need for a transformative impact on atmospheric CO2 levels.

### 4. Selection of the Kerguelen Plateau as the Proposed Detonation Site
**Rationale:** The Kerguelen Plateau is chosen due to its geological characteristics, including extensive basalt deposits, and its remote location, which minimizes risks to human populations and ecosystems. The depth of the ocean at this site also provides a natural barrier to contain the explosion's effects, reducing the potential for widespread fallout and radiation exposure.

### 5. Design Considerations for Minimizing Long-Term Radiation Effects
**Rationale:** The design of the nuclear device aims to minimize long-term radiation effects by utilizing a fission-fusion hydrogen bomb design, which is expected to produce less long-lived radioactive waste. The surrounding basalt is anticipated to absorb and contain much of the radiation, limiting its spread and impact on the environment.

### 6. Assumption of 90% Efficiency in Pulverizing Basalt
**Rationale:** The assumption of 90% efficiency is based on historical data from nuclear tests and theoretical models of explosive fragmentation. This high efficiency is critical to ensure that the energy released from the explosion is effectively utilized to maximize the surface area of the basalt, thereby enhancing the weathering process and subsequent CO2 sequestration.

### 7. Evaluation of Safety Measures for Detonation in a Remote Location
**Rationale:** Conducting the detonation in a remote underwater location is intended to mitigate risks associated with human exposure and environmental damage. The researchers emphasize the importance of thorough safety protocols, including timing the detonation to coincide with favorable weather conditions to minimize fallout and ensuring that the explosion is contained within a controlled environment.

### 8. Comparison of Ecological Impacts Between Nuclear Explosion and Climate Change
**Rationale:** The researchers argue that while a nuclear explosion will have immediate localized ecological impacts, the long-term effects of unchecked climate change pose a far greater risk to global ecosystems. This comparison is intended to justify the radical approach by highlighting the potential for nuclear intervention to prevent more extensive ecological degradation caused by climate change.

### 9. Assessment of Political Feasibility Regarding Nuclear Treaties
**Rationale:** The researchers acknowledge the challenges posed by existing nuclear treaties but argue that the urgency of climate change may warrant exceptions or new frameworks for cooperation. They propose that the clear purpose of the detonation for carbon sequestration could facilitate dialogue and mitigate tensions surrounding nuclear proliferation.

### 10. Financial Analysis Supporting the Cost-Effectiveness of the Proposed Method
**Rationale:** The financial analysis suggests that the cost of the nuclear detonation (estimated at around $10 billion) is a fraction of the projected costs of climate change (up to $100 trillion). This stark contrast in potential costs serves to highlight the economic viability of the proposed method as a proactive measure against climate change.

### 11. Assumption of Climate Change Progression Influencing Project Urgency
**Rationale:** The researchers assume that climate change will continue to progress according to current models, necessitating urgent action. This assumption underscores the need for innovative solutions that can be deployed rapidly to mitigate the impending impacts of climate change.

### 12. Decision to Prioritize Rapid Rock Weathering for Carbon Capture
**Rationale:** The decision to prioritize rapid rock weathering is based on the understanding that
