- **Objective**: Utilize buried nuclear explosions in basaltic seabeds to enhance carbon sequestration via Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW).
  
- **Key Assumptions**:
  - Annual CO₂ emissions: 36 Gt.
  - Target sequestration: 30 years of emissions (1.08 trillion tons of CO₂).
  - Basalt efficiency: 1 ton basalt sequesters 0.28 tons CO₂.
  - Crushing work index of basalt: 22.
  - Explosion efficiency: 90% in pulverizing basalt.

- **Yield Requirement**: 
  - Required basalt: 3.86 trillion tons.
  - Crushing energy needed: \(3.05 \times 10^{20} \, \text{J}\).
  - Required nuclear explosion yield: 81 Gt (gigatons).

- **Proposed Location**: Kerguelen Plateau, Southern Ocean.
  - Depth: 3-5 km into basalt, 6-8 km below water surface.
  - Pressure: ~800 atm to absorb explosion energy.

- **Safety Considerations**:
  - Controlled detonation minimizes human impact.
  - Expected radiation effects deemed manageable compared to climate change impacts (30 million lives lost by 2100).

- **Ecosystem Impact**:
  - Localized destruction at detonation site; long-term uninhabitability.
  - Climate change poses greater risk to global ecosystems through habitat loss, ocean acidification, and extreme weather.

- **Political Feasibility**:
  - Proposal violates existing nuclear treaties but can be justified as a climate intervention.
  - Importance of clear communication and potential treaty exceptions.

- **Financial Viability**:
  - Cost of nuclear device: ~$10 billion.
  - Expected climate change damage: $100 trillion by 2100.
  - Return on investment: 10,000x.

- **Conclusion**: The proposed method of using nuclear explosions for ERW presents a radical yet potentially effective solution for large-scale carbon sequestration, balancing safety, ecological, political, and financial factors.
