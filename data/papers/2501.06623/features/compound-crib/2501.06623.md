The proposal to utilize buried nuclear explosions in basaltic seabeds for Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW) as a means of carbon sequestration is a complex and multifaceted approach that requires careful consideration of various technical, environmental, political, and economic factors. Below is a detailed technical explanation and justification for the researchers' decisions regarding the key aspects of this proposal.

### Objective: Utilizing Buried Nuclear Explosions for ERW

The primary objective of this research is to leverage the energy from nuclear explosions to pulverize basalt, thereby enhancing the natural weathering process that sequesters carbon dioxide (CO₂). Basalt is chosen due to its high mineral content and ability to react with CO₂, forming stable carbonates. The rationale behind using nuclear explosions is to overcome the logistical and energy-intensive challenges associated with traditional methods of mining, crushing, and transporting basalt.

### Key Assumptions

1. **Annual CO₂ Emissions**: The assumption of 36 gigatons of CO₂ emissions annually is based on current global emissions data. This figure provides a benchmark for the scale of intervention required to make a significant impact on atmospheric CO₂ levels.

2. **Target Sequestration**: The goal of sequestering 1.08 trillion tons of CO₂ over 30 years aligns with the need to address a substantial portion of future emissions, thereby contributing to climate stabilization efforts.

3. **Basalt Efficiency**: The efficiency of basalt in sequestering CO₂ (0.28 tons of CO₂ per ton of basalt) is derived from existing geological and chemical studies, which validate the effectiveness of basalt weathering in capturing atmospheric CO₂.

4. **Crushing Work Index**: The crushing work index of basalt (22) informs the energy requirements for pulverization, which is critical for estimating the total energy needed for the proposed nuclear explosions.

5. **Explosion Efficiency**: The assumption of 90% efficiency in pulverizing basalt is based on historical data from nuclear tests and theoretical models of energy transfer in geological materials.

### Yield Requirement

The calculations leading to the requirement of 3.86 trillion tons of basalt and the associated energy needs (3.05 × 10^20 J) are grounded in the principles of thermodynamics and material science. The proposed yield of 81 gigatons for the nuclear explosion is necessary to achieve the required pulverization of basalt, which is significantly larger than any previous nuclear detonation. This highlights the unprecedented scale of the intervention.

### Proposed Location: Kerguelen Plateau

The choice of the Kerguelen Plateau as the detonation site is strategic. The depth of 3-5 km into basalt and 6-8 km below the water surface provides a natural barrier that can contain the explosion's energy and minimize surface effects. The high pressure (approximately 800 atm) at this depth is expected to absorb much of the explosion's energy, reducing the risk of widespread environmental damage. Additionally, the location's remoteness limits human exposure and potential geopolitical tensions.

### Safety Considerations

The safety rationale for controlled detonation is paramount. By confining the explosion to a remote underwater location, the researchers aim to mitigate risks associated with radiation exposure and environmental contamination. The comparison of potential radiation effects to the projected human toll from climate change (30 million lives lost by 2100) underscores the argument that the proposed intervention could be a lesser evil in the context of global existential threats.

### Ecosystem Impact

While acknowledging the localized destruction at the detonation site, the researchers argue that the long-term impacts of climate change pose a far greater risk to global ecosystems. The analysis emphasizes that the immediate ecological consequences of the explosion are contained and manageable compared to the widespread habitat loss, ocean acidification, and extreme weather events driven by climate change.

### Political Feasibility

The proposal's political feasibility is complex, given that it violates existing nuclear treaties. However, the researchers argue for the potential justification of such actions as a necessary climate intervention. They emphasize the importance of transparent communication and the possibility of treaty exceptions in light of the urgent need for innovative climate solutions.

### Financial Viability

The financial analysis presents a compelling case for the proposed intervention. With an estimated cost of $10 billion for the nuclear device against projected climate change damages of $100 trillion by 2100, the return on investment (10,000x) is significant. This economic rationale supports the argument for pursuing radical solutions to address the climate crisis.

### Conclusion

In summary, the researchers' decisions regarding the use of buried nuclear explosions for ERW are grounded in a comprehensive analysis of technical, environmental, political, and economic factors. While the approach is radical, the justification rests on the urgent need for large-scale carbon sequestration solutions in the face of escalating climate change impacts. The proposal invites further exploration and discussion of innovative methods to combat one of humanity's most pressing challenges.
