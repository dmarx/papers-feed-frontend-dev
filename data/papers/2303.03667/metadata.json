  "abstract": "To design fast neural networks, many works have been focusing on reducing the\nnumber of floating-point operations (FLOPs). We observe that such reduction in\nFLOPs, however, does not necessarily lead to a similar level of reduction in\nlatency. This mainly stems from inefficiently low floating-point operations per\nsecond (FLOPS). To achieve faster networks, we revisit popular operators and\ndemonstrate that such low FLOPS is mainly due to frequent memory access of the\noperators, especially the depthwise convolution. We hence propose a novel\npartial convolution (PConv) that extracts spatial features more efficiently, by\ncutting down redundant computation and memory access simultaneously. Building\nupon our PConv, we further propose FasterNet, a new family of neural networks,\nwhich attains substantially higher running speed than others on a wide range of\ndevices, without compromising on accuracy for various vision tasks. For\nexample, on ImageNet-1k, our tiny FasterNet-T0 is $2.8\\times$, $3.3\\times$, and\n$2.4\\times$ faster than MobileViT-XXS on GPU, CPU, and ARM processors,\nrespectively, while being $2.9\\%$ more accurate. Our large FasterNet-L achieves\nimpressive $83.5\\%$ top-1 accuracy, on par with the emerging Swin-B, while\nhaving $36\\%$ higher inference throughput on GPU, as well as saving $37\\%$\ncompute time on CPU.
