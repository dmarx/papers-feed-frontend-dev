<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>To design fast neural networks, many works have been focusing on reducing the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs). We observe that such reduction in FLOPs, however, does not necessarily lead to a similar level of reduction in latency. This mainly stems from inefficiently low floating-point operations per second (FLOPS). To achieve faster networks, we revisit popular operators and demonstrate that such low FLOPS is mainly due to frequent memory access of the operators, especially the depthwise convolution. We hence propose a novel partial convolution (PConv) that extracts spatial features more efficiently, by cutting down redundant computation and memory access simultaneously. Building upon our PConv, we further propose FasterNet, a new family of neural networks, which attains substantially higher running speed than others on a wide range of devices, without compromising on accuracy for various vision tasks. For example, on ImageNet-1k, our tiny FasterNet-T0 is 2.8×, 3.3×, and 2.4× faster than MobileViT-XXS on GPU, CPU, and ARM processors, respectively, while being 2.9% more accurate. Our large FasterNet-L achieves impressive 83.5% top-1 accuracy, on par with the emerging Swin-B, while having 36% higher inference throughput on GPU, as well as saving 37% compute time on CPU.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Neural networks have undergone rapid development in various computer vision tasks such as image classification, detection and segmentation. While their impressive performance has powered many applications, a roaring trend is to pursue fast neural networks with low latency and high throughput for great user experiences, instant responses, safety reasons, etc.</p><p>How to be fast? Instead of asking for more costly computing devices, researchers and practitioners prefer to design cost-effective fast neural networks with reduced computational complexity, mainly measured in the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . MobileNets <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>, ShuffleNets <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84]</ref> and GhostNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, among others, leverage the depthwise convolution (DWConv) <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> and/or group convolution (GConv) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> to extract spatial features. However, in the effort to reduce FLOPs, the operators often suffer from the side effect of increased memory access. MicroNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> further decomposes and sparsifies the network to push its FLOPs to an extremely low level. Despite its improvement in FLOPs, this approach experiences inefficient fragmented computation. Besides, the above networks are often accompanied by additional data manipulations, such as concatenation, shuffling, and pooling, whose running time tends to be significant for tiny models. Apart from the above pure convolutional neural networks (CNNs), there is an emerging interest in making vision transformers (ViTs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) architectures <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> smaller and faster. For example, MobileViTs <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70]</ref> and MobileFormer <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> reduce the computational complexity by combining DWConv with a modified attention mechanism. However, they still suffer from the aforementioned issue with DWConv and also need dedicated hardware support for the modified attention mechanism. The use of advanced yet time-consuming nor- malization and activation layers may also limit their speed on devices.</p><p>All these issues together lead to the following question: Are these "fast" neural networks really fast? To answer this, we examine the relationship between latency and FLOPs, which is captured by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Latency = F LOP s F LOP S ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where FLOPS is short for floating-point operations per second, as a measure of the effective computational speed. While there are many attempts to reduce FLOPs, they seldom consider optimizing FLOPS at the same time to achieve truly low latency. To better understand the situation, we compare the FLOPS of typical neural networks on an Intel CPU. The results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> show that many existing neural networks suffer from low FLOPS, and their FLOPS is generally lower than the popular ResNet50. With such low FLOPS, these "fast" neural networks are actually not fast enough. Their reduction in FLOPs cannot be translated into the exact amount of reduction in latency. In some cases, there is no improvement, and it even leads to worse latency. For example, CycleMLP-B1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> has half of FLOPs of ResNet50 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> but runs more slowly (i.e., CycleMLP-B1 vs. ResNet50: 116.1ms vs. 73.0ms). Note that this discrepancy between FLOPs and latency has also been noticed in previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref> but remains unresolved partially because they employ the DWConv/GConv and various data manipulations with low FLOPS. It is deemed there are no better alternatives available. This paper aims to eliminate the discrepancy by developing a simple yet fast and effective operator that maintains high FLOPS with reduced FLOPs. Specifically, we reexamine existing operators, particularly DWConv, in terms of the computational speed -FLOPS. We uncover that the main reason causing the low FLOPS issue is frequent memory access. We then propose a novel partial convolution (PConv) as a competitive alternative that reduces the computational redundancy as well as the number of memory access. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates the design of our PConv. It takes advantage of redundancy within the feature maps and systematically applies a regular convolution (Conv) on only a part of the input channels while leaving the remaining ones untouched. By nature, PConv has lower FLOPs than the regular Conv while having higher FLOPS than the DWConv/GConv. In other words, PConv better exploits the on-device computational capacity. PConv is also effective in extracting spatial features as empirically validated later in the paper.</p><p>We further introduce FasterNet, which is primarily built upon our PConv, as a new family of networks that run highly fast on various devices. In particular, our FasterNet achieves state-of-the-art performance for classification, detection, and segmentation tasks while having much lower latency and higher throughput. For example, our tiny FasterNet-T0 is 2.8×, 3.3×, and 2.4× faster than MobileViT-XXS <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> on GPU, CPU, and ARM processors, respectively, while being 2.9% more accurate on ImageNet-1k. Our large FasterNet-L achieves 83.5% top-1 accuracy, on par with the emerging Swin-B <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, while offering 36% higher throughput on GPU and saving 37% compute time on CPU. To summarize, our contributions are as follows:</p><p>• We point out the importance of achieving higher FLOPS beyond simply reducing FLOPs for faster neural networks.</p><p>• We introduce a simple yet fast and effective operator called PConv, which has a high potential to replace the existing go-to choice, DWConv.</p><p>• We introduce FasterNet which runs favorably and universally fast on a variety of devices such as GPU, CPU, and ARM processors.</p><p>• We conduct extensive experiments on various tasks and validate the high speed and effectiveness of our PConv and FasterNet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>We briefly review prior works on fast and efficient neural networks and differentiate this work from them.</p><p>CNN. CNNs are the mainstream architecture in the computer vision field, especially when it comes to deployment in practice, where being fast is as important as being accurate. Though there have been numerous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">86]</ref> to achieve higher efficiency, the rationale behind them is more or less to perform a low-rank approximation. Specifically, the group convolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and the depthwise separable convolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> (consisting of depthwise and pointwise convolutions) are probably the most popular ones. They have been widely adopted in mobile/edge-oriented networks, such as Mo-bileNets <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>, ShuffleNets <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84]</ref>, GhostNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, EfficientNets <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62]</ref>, TinyNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, Xception <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, Con-denseNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78]</ref>, TVConv <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, MnasNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>, and FB-Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. While they exploit the redundancy in filters to reduce the number of parameters and FLOPs, they suffer from increased memory access when increasing the network width to compensate for the accuracy drop. By contrast, we consider the redundancy in feature maps and propose a partial convolution to reduce FLOPs and memory access simultaneously.</p><p>ViT, MLP, and variants. There is a growing interest in studying ViT ever since Dosovitskiy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> expanded the application scope of transformers <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref> from machine translation <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref> or forecasting <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref> to the computer vision field. Many follow-up works have attempted to improve ViT in terms of training setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66]</ref> and model design <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">85]</ref>. One notable trend is to pursue a better accuracy-latency trade-off by reducing the complexity of the attention operator <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref>, incorporating convolution into ViTs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>, or doing both <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>. Besides, other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64]</ref> propose to replace the attention with simple MLP-based operators. However, they often evolve to be CNN-like <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the convolution operations, particularly DWConv, due to the following reasons: First, the advantage of attention over convolution is unclear or debatable <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71]</ref>. Second, the attention-based mechanism generally runs slower than its convolutional counterparts and thus becomes less favorable for the current industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>. Finally, DW-Conv is still a popular choice in many hybrid models, so it is worth a careful examination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Design of PConv and FasterNet</head><p>In this section, we first revisit DWConv and analyze the issue with its frequent memory access. We then introduce PConv as a competitive alternative operator to resolve the issue. After that, we introduce FasterNet and explain its details, including design considerations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Preliminary</head><p>DWConv is a popular variant of Conv and has been widely adopted as a key building block for many neural networks. For an input I ∈ R c×h×w , DWConv applies c filters W ∈ R k×k to compute the output O ∈ R c×h×w . As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(b)</ref>, each filter slides spatially on one input channel and contributes to one output channel. This depthwise computation makes DWConv have as low FLOPs as h × w × k 2 × c compared to a regular Conv with h × w × k 2 × c 2 . While effective in reducing FLOPs, a DWConv, which is typically followed by a pointwise convolution, or PWConv, cannot be simply used to replace a regular Conv as it would incur a severe accuracy drop. Thus, in practice the channel number c (or the network width) of DWConv is increased to c ′ (c ′ &gt; c) to compensate the accuracy drop, e.g., the width is expanded by six times for the DWConv in the inverted residual blocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. This, however, results in much higher memory access that can cause non-negligible delay and slow down the overall computation, especially for I/O-bound devices. In particular, the number of memory access now escalates to</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">h × w × 2c ′ + k 2 × c ′ ≈ h × w × 2c ′ ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>which is higher than that of a regular Conv, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">h × w × 2c + k 2 × c 2 ≈ h × w × 2c.<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Note that the h × w × 2c ′ memory access is spent on the I/O operation, which is deemed to be already the minimum cost and hard to optimize further.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Partial convolution as a basic operator</head><p>We below demonstrate that the cost can be further optimized by leveraging the feature maps' redundancy. As visualized in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, the feature maps share high similarities among different channels. This redundancy has also been covered in many other works <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">82]</ref>, but few of them make full use of it in a simple yet effective way.</p><p>Specifically, we propose a simple PConv to reduce computational redundancy and memory access simultaneously. The bottom-left corner in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> illustrates how our PConv works. It simply applies a regular Conv on only a part of the input channels for spatial feature extraction and leaves the remaining channels untouched. For contiguous or regular memory access, we consider the first or last consecutive c p channels as the representatives of the whole feature maps for computation. Without loss of generality, we consider the input and output feature maps to have the same number of channels. Therefore, the FLOPs of a PConv are only</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">h × w × k 2 × c 2 p .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>With a typical partial ratio r = cp c = 1 4 , the FLOPs of a PConv is only 1  16 of a regular Conv. Besides, PConv has a smaller amount of memory access, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">h × w × 2c p + k 2 × c 2 p ≈ h × w × 2c p ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>which is only 1 4 of a regular Conv for r = 1 4 . Since there are only c p channels utilized for spatial feature extraction, one may ask if we can simply remove the remaining (c -c p ) channels? If so, PConv would degrade to a regular Conv with fewer channels, which deviates from our objective to reduce redundancy. Note that we keep the remaining channels untouched instead of removing them from the feature maps. It is because they are useful for a subsequent PWConv layer, which allows the feature information to flow through all channels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">PConv followed by PWConv</head><p>To fully and efficiently leverage the information from all channels, we further append a pointwise convolution (PW-Conv) to our PConv. Their effective receptive field together on the input feature maps looks like a T-shaped Conv, which focuses more on the center position compared to a regular Conv uniformly processing a patch, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>. To justify this T-shaped receptive field, we first evaluate the importance of each position by calculating the position-wise Frobenius norm. We assume that a position tends to be more important if it has a larger Frobenius norm than other positions. For a regular Conv filter F ∈ R k 2 ×c , the Frobenius norm at position i is calculated by</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">∥F i ∥ = c j=1 |f ij | 2 , for i = 1, 2, 3..., k 2 .</formula><p>We consider a salient position to be the one with the maximum Frobenius norm. We then collectively examine each filter in a pre-trained ResNet18, find out their salient positions, and plot a histogram of the salient positions. Results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> show that the center position turns out to be the salient position most frequently among the filters. In other words, the center position weighs more than its surrounding neighbors. This is consistent with the T-shaped computation which concentrates on the center position.</p><p>While the T-shaped Conv can be directly used for efficient computation, we show that it is better to decompose the T-shaped Conv into a PConv and a PWConv because the decomposition exploits the inter-filter redundancy and further saves FLOPs. For the same input I ∈ R c×h×w and output O ∈ R c×h×w , a T-shaped Conv's FLOPs can be calculated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">h × w × k 2 × c p × c + c × (c -c p ) ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>which is higher than the FLOPs of a PConv and a PWConv,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">i.e., h × w × (k 2 × c 2 p + c 2 ),<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where (k 2 -1)c &gt; k 2 c p , e.g. when c p = c 4 and k = 3. Besides, we can readily leverage the regular Conv for the two-step implementation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">FasterNet as a general backbone</head><p>Given our novel PConv and off-the-shelf PWConv as the primary building operators, we further propose FasterNet, a new family of neural networks that runs favorably fast and is highly effective for many vision tasks. We aim to keep the architecture as simple as possible, without bells and whistles, to make it hardware-friendly in general.</p><p>We present the overall architecture in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. It has four hierarchical stages, each of which is preceded by an embedding layer (a regular Conv 4 × 4 with stride 4) or a merging layer (a regular Conv 2 × 2 with stride 2) for spatial downsampling and channel number expanding. Each stage has a stack of FasterNet blocks. We observe that the blocks in the last two stages consume less memory access and tend to have higher FLOPS, as empirically validated in Tab. 1. Thus, we put more FasterNet blocks and correspondingly assign more computations to the last two stages. Each FasterNet block has a PConv layer followed by two PWConv (or Conv 1 × 1) layers. Together, they appear as inverted residual blocks where the middle layer has an expanded number of channels, and a shortcut connection is placed to reuse the input features.</p><p>In addition to the above operators, the normalization and activation layers are also indispensable for high-performing neural networks. Many prior works <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>, however, overuse such layers throughout the network, which may limit the feature diversity and thus hurt the performance. It can also slow down the overall computation. By contrast, we put them only after each middle PWConv to preserve the feature diversity and achieve lower latency. Besides, we use the batch normalization (BN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> instead of other alternative ones [2, 67, 75]. The benefit of BN is that it can be merged into its adjacent Conv layers for faster inference * = FasterNet Block Input FasterNet Block Stage 1 𝑐 1 x ℎ 4 x 𝑤 4 FasterNet Block Stage 2 𝑐 2 x ℎ 8 x 𝑤 8 FasterNet Block Stage 3 𝑐 3 x ℎ 16 x 𝑤 16 FasterNet Block Stage 4 𝑐 4 x ℎ 32 x 𝑤 32 Global Pool Conv 1x1 FC Output Conv 1x1 Conv 1x1 Embedding Merging Merging Merging PConv 3x3 BN, ReLU ⨁ x 𝑙 2 x 𝑙 3 x 𝑙 4 x 𝑙 1 Input 𝑐 𝑝 Filters Output ℎ 𝑤 𝑐 𝑝 ℎ 𝑤 𝑐 𝑝 𝑘 𝑘 Partial Convolution (PConv) 𝑐 𝑝 … Identity  while being as effective as the others. As for the activation layers, we empirically choose GELU <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> for smaller FasterNet variants and ReLU <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> for bigger FasterNet variants, considering both running time and effectiveness. The last three layers, i.e. a global average pooling, a Conv 1 × 1, and a fully-connected layer, are used together for feature transformation and classification.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">𝑐 𝑝 𝑐 k k 1 1 𝑐 𝑝 k k 𝑐 𝑐 -𝑐 𝑝</formula><p>To serve a wide range of applications under different computational budgets, we provide tiny, small, medium, and large variants of FasterNet, referred to as FasterNet-T0/1/2, FasterNet-S, FasterNet-M, and FasterNet-L, respectively. They share a similar architecture but vary in depth and width. Detailed architecture specifications are provided in the appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Experimental Results</head><p>We first examine the computational speed of our PConv and its effectiveness when combined with a PWConv. We then comprehensively evaluate the performance of our FasterNet for classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. Finally, we conduct a brief ablation study.</p><p>To benchmark the latency and throughput, we choose the following three typical processors, which cover a wide range of computational capacity: GPU (2080Ti), CPU (Intel i9-9900X, using a single thread), and ARM (Cortex-A72, using a single thread). We report their latency for inputs with a batch size of 1 and throughput for inputs with a batch size of 32. During inference, the BN layers are merged to their adjacent layers wherever applicable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">PConv is fast with high FLOPS</head><p>We below show that our PConv is fast and better exploits the on-device computational capacity. Specifically, we stack 10 layers of pure PConv and take feature maps of typical dimensions as inputs. We then measure FLOPs and latency/throughput on GPU, CPU, and ARM processors, which also allow us to further compute FLOPS. We repeat the same procedure for other convolutional variants and make comparisons.</p><p>Results in Tab. latency/throughput are unaffordable. GConv and DWConv, despite their significant reduction in FLOPs, suffer from a drastic decrease in FLOPS. In addition, they tend to increase the number of channels to compensate for the performance drop, which, however, increase their latency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">PConv is effective together with PWConv</head><p>We next show that a PConv followed by a PWConv is effective in approximating a regular Conv to transform the feature maps. To this end, we first build four datasets by feeding the ImageNet-1k val split images into a pre-trained ResNet50, and extract the feature maps before and after the first Conv 3 × 3 in each of the four stages. Each feature map dataset is further spilt into the train (70%), val (10%), and test (20%) subsets. We then build a simple network consisting of a PConv followed by a PWConv and train it on the feature map datasets with a mean squared error loss. For comparison, we also build and train networks for DWConv + PWConv and GConv + PWConv under the same setting.</p><p>Tab. 2 shows that PConv + PWConv achieve the lowest test loss, meaning that they better approximate a regular Conv in feature transformation. The results also suggest that it is sufficient and efficient to capture spatial features from only a part of the feature maps. PConv shows a great potential to be the new go-to choice in designing fast and effective neural networks.</p></div>

From another perspective, FasterNet runs faster than various CNN, ViT and MLP models on a wide range of devices, when having similar top-1 accuracy. As quantitatively shown in Tab. 3, FasterNet-T0 is 2.8×, 3.3×, and 2.4× faster than MobileViT-XXS <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> on GPU, CPU, and ARM processors, respectively, while being 2.9% more accurate.

FasterNet consistently outperforms ResNet and ResNext by having higher average precision (AP) with similar latency. Specifically, FasterNet-S yields +1.9 higher box AP and +2.4 higher mask AP compared to the standard baseline ResNet50. FasterNet is also competitive against the ViT variants. Under similar FLOPs, FasterNet-L reduces PVT-Large's latency by 38%, i.e., from 152.2 ms to 93.8 ms on GPU, and achieves +1.1 higher box AP and +0.4 higher mask AP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Ablation study</head><p>We conduct a brief ablation study on the value of partial ratio r and the choices of activation and normalization layers. We compare different variants in terms of ImageNet top-1 accuracy and on-device latency/throughput. Results are summarized in Tab. 5. For the partial ratio r, we set it to 1  4 for all FasterNet variants by default, which achieves higher accuracy, higher throughput, and lower latency at similar complexity. A too large partial ratio r would make PConv degrade to a regular Conv, while a too small value would render PConv less effective in capturing the spatial features. For the normalization layers, we choose Batch-Norm over LayerNorm because BatchNorm can be merged into its adjacent convolutional layers for faster inference while it is as effective as LayerNorm in our experiment. For the activation function, interestingly, we empirically found that GELU fits FasterNet-T0/T1 models more efficiently than ReLU. It, however, becomes opposite for FasterNet-T2/S/M/L. Here we only show two examples in Tab. 5 due to space constraint. We conjecture that GELU strengthens FasterNet-T0/T1 by having higher non-linearity, while the benefit fades away for larger FasterNet variants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we have investigated the common and unresolved issue that many established neural networks suffer from low floating-point operations per second (FLOPS). We have revisited a bottleneck operator, DWConv, and analyzed its main cause for a slowdown -frequent memory access. To overcome the issue and achieve faster neural networks, we have proposed a simple yet fast and effective operator, PConv, that can be readily plugged into many existing networks. We have further introduced our generalpurpose FasterNet, built upon our PConv, that achieves state-of-the-art speed and accuracy trade-off on various devices and vision tasks. We hope that our PConv and Faster-Net would inspire more research on simple yet effective neural networks, going beyond academia to impact the industry and community directly.</p></div>

They can be used for reproducing our main results in Tab. 3 and Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. Different FasterNet variants vary in the magnitude of regularization and augmentation techniques. The magnitude increases as the model becomes larger to alleviate overfitting and improve accuracy. Note that most of the compared works in Tab. 3 and Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>, e.g., Mobile-ViT, EdgeNext, PVT, CycleMLP, ConvNeXt, Swin, etc., also adopt such advanced training techniques (ADT). Some even heavily rely on the hyper-parameter search.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Limitations and future work</head><p>We have demonstrated that PConv and FasterNet are fast and effective, being competitive with existing operators and networks. Yet there are some minor technical limitations of this paper. For one thing, PConv is designed to apply a regular convolution on only a part of the input channels while leaving the remaining ones untouched. Thus, the stride of the partial convolution should always be 1, in order to align the spatial resolution of the convolutional output and that of the untouched channels. Note that it is still feasible to down-sample the spatial resolution as there can be addi-tional downsampling layers in the architecture. And for another, our FasterNet is simply built upon convolutional operators with a possibly limited receptive field. Future efforts can be made to enlarge its receptive field and combine it with other operators to pursue higher accuracy.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure1.
