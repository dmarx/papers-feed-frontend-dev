The paper "Run, Don't Walk: Chasing Higher FLOPS for Faster Neural Networks" presents a compelling argument for optimizing both FLOPs (Floating Point Operations) and FLOPS (Floating Point Operations Per Second) to achieve lower latency in neural networks. Below is a detailed technical explanation of the researchers' decisions regarding these concepts, particularly focusing on the proposed Partial Convolution (PConv) and the FasterNet architecture.

### Key Concept: Optimizing FLOPs and FLOPS

1. **Understanding FLOPs and FLOPS**:
   - **FLOPs**: This metric quantifies the total number of floating-point operations required to process an input through a neural network. While reducing FLOPs is a common goal, it does not directly correlate with reduced latency.
   - **FLOPS**: This metric measures the effective computational speed of a system, indicating how many floating-point operations can be performed in one second. The relationship between latency, FLOPs, and FLOPS is given by the equation:
     \[
     \text{Latency} = \frac{\text{FLOPs}}{\text{FLOPS}}
     \]
   - The researchers emphasize that merely reducing FLOPs can lead to low FLOPS if the architecture leads to inefficient memory access patterns, which can negate the benefits of reduced FLOPs.

2. **Importance of Memory Access**:
   - The paper identifies frequent memory access as a significant contributor to low FLOPS. Depthwise Convolution (DWConv), a popular operation in lightweight networks, suffers from this issue. The researchers argue that high memory access can lead to increased latency, even if FLOPs are low.

### Depthwise Convolution (DWConv) Limitations

1. **Low FLOPS Due to High Memory Access**:
   - DWConv is designed to reduce FLOPs by applying a single filter per input channel. However, to maintain accuracy, the number of channels is often increased, leading to higher memory access:
     \[
     \text{Memory Access} \approx h \times w \times 2c' \quad (c' > c)
     \]
   - This increased memory access can slow down computations, especially on I/O-bound devices, as the cost of memory access is significant and hard to optimize.

### Introduction of Partial Convolution (PConv)

1. **PConv as an Alternative**:
   - The researchers propose PConv to address the inefficiencies of DWConv. PConv reduces both computational redundancy and memory access by applying convolution only to a subset of channels, thus maintaining a balance between FLOPs and FLOPS.
   - The FLOPs for PConv are calculated as:
     \[
     \text{FLOPs} = h \times w \times k^2 \times c^2_p \quad (c_p \text{ is the number of utilized channels})
     \]
   - The memory access for PConv is significantly lower:
     \[
     \text{Memory Access} \approx h \times w \times 2c_p
     \]
   - By leveraging redundancy in feature maps, PConv achieves lower FLOPs while maintaining higher FLOPS compared to DWConv.

### Design of FasterNet

1. **FasterNet Architecture**:
   - FasterNet is built upon the PConv operator, designed to maximize speed and efficiency across various devices. The architecture aims to achieve high throughput and low latency without sacrificing accuracy.
   - The researchers validate the performance of FasterNet through extensive experiments, demonstrating that it outperforms existing models like MobileViT-XXS and Swin-B in terms of speed and accuracy.

2. **Performance Metrics**:
   - For instance, FasterNet-T0 is reported to be 2.8×, 3.3×, and 2.4× faster than MobileViT-XXS on GPU, CPU, and ARM, respectively, while achieving 2.9% higher accuracy on ImageNet-1k.
   - The larger model, FasterNet-L, achieves 83.5% top-1 accuracy, with 36% higher throughput on GPU and 37% less compute time on CPU compared to Swin-B.

### Design Considerations

1. **Exploiting Redundancy**:
   - PConv is designed to exploit redundancy in feature maps, applying convolution selectively to a subset of channels. This selective approach reduces unnecessary computations and memory access, leading to improved performance.
   - The combination of PConv with Pointwise Convolution (PWConv) creates a T-shaped receptive field, which focuses on the center position of the input, enhancing feature extraction.

### Experimental Validation

1. **Extensive Testing**:
   - The researchers conducted a series of experiments across various vision tasks to validate the effectiveness of PConv and FasterNet. The results consistently showed that these innovations lead to significant improvements in both speed and accuracy.

### Conclusion

The decisions made by the researchers in this paper are grounded in a thorough understanding of the trade-offs between FLOPs, FLO
