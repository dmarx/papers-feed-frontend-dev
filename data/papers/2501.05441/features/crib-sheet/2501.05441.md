- **Key Claim**: GANs can be trained effectively without relying on numerous empirical tricks; a principled approach can yield better results.
  
- **Proposed Loss**: Regularized Relativistic GAN (RpGAN) loss is introduced to improve stability and convergence:
  \[
  L(θ, ψ) = E_{z∼p_z} E_{x∼p_D} [f(D_ψ(G_θ(z)) - D_ψ(x))]
  \]

- **Convergence Guarantees**: The proposed loss admits local convergence guarantees, contrasting with many existing relativistic losses that do not.

- **Zero-Centered Gradient Penalties**: Two types of penalties are used to ensure convergence:
  - \( R_1(ψ) = γ^2 E_{x∼p_D} \|∇_x D_ψ\|^2 \)
  - \( R_2(θ, ψ) = γ^2 E_{x∼p_θ} \|∇_x D_ψ\|^2 \)

- **Training Dynamics**: The combination of \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) regularization leads to stable training and full mode coverage, as shown in experiments with StackedMNIST.

- **Performance Comparison**: The minimalist baseline-R3GAN outperforms StyleGAN2 on multiple datasets (FFHQ, ImageNet, CIFAR, Stacked MNIST) while using fewer tricks.

- **Backbone Architecture**: The paper emphasizes the need to modernize GAN architectures by integrating designs from contemporary ConvNets and transformers, such as:
  - Proper ResNet design
  - Initialization techniques
  - Grouped convolution
  - No normalization layers

- **Empirical Results**: The proposed method achieves a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 2.75 on FFHQ-256, compared to 3.78 for StyleGAN.

- **Mode Coverage**: RpGAN with both \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) achieves full mode coverage (1000 modes) on StackedMNIST, while traditional GANs struggle with mode dropping.

- **Gradient Behavior**: The analysis shows that \( R_1 \) alone is insufficient for convergence; both \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) are necessary to stabilize training dynamics.

- **Conclusion**: The work demonstrates that GANs can be simplified and made more effective through a well-defined loss function and modern architectural choices, challenging the notion that GANs are inherently difficult to train.
