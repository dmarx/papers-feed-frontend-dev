- **Study Objective**: Investigate the impact of artistic expertise on the use of generative AI for image creation tasks among professional artists and laypeople.
  
- **Key Hypotheses**:
  - H1: Artists' images in the copying task will be closer to the original than laypeople's.
  - H2: Artists' images in the creative task will be more distant from the original than laypeople's.
  - H3: Artists will choose more suitable images in the curation phase compared to laypeople.

- **Experimental Design**:
  - Two tasks: **Copying Task** (replicate a reference image) and **Creative Task** (generate a maximally different image).
  - Participants: 50 professional artists vs. 49 demographically matched laypeople.
  - Use of a bespoke platform with a modern text-to-image model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).

- **Data Analysis**:
  - Similarity measured using cosine vector similarity based on image embeddings.
  - Comparison of outputs between human participants and a vision-capable large language model (GPT-4o).

- **Findings**:
  - Artists produced more faithful and creative outputs than laypeople, but the difference was small.
  - GPT-4o performed comparably in copying but outperformed artists in the creative task.
  - The best results were still produced by human participants in both tasks.

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Collected sentiments towards AI usage among participants, highlighting differences in perception between artists and laypeople.

- **Implications**:
  - Emphasizes the need for integrating artistic skills with AI training in education.
  - Suggests potential for collaborative synergy between artists and generative AI tools.

- **Ethical Considerations**: Discusses the implications of AI on job markets and the creative professions, including concerns about "AI anxiety" and the potential redundancy of human creators.

- **Visual Representation**: 
  - Figure 1: Overview of the study's motivation and experimental pipeline (not included here, but essential for understanding the methodology).

- **Conclusion**: While AI tools can ease content creation, professional expertise remains valuable, indicating a need for a balanced approach in art education that incorporates both traditional skills and AI proficiency.
