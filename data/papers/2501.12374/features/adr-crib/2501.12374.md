### Detailed Technical Explanations/Justifications/Rationale for Research Decisions

#### 1. Decision to Compare Professional Artists with Laypeople
The rationale for comparing professional artists with laypeople stems from the need to understand the impact of expertise on the use of generative AI tools in artistic creation. Professional artists possess training, experience, and a nuanced understanding of artistic principles, which may influence their ability to effectively utilize AI for both copying and creative tasks. By contrasting these two groups, the study aims to elucidate whether expertise translates into superior outcomes when engaging with AI, thereby providing insights into the role of artistic education in the age of AI.

#### 2. Choice of Tasks: Copying vs. Creative Image Generation
The selection of tasks—copying a reference image and generating a creative variant—was designed to reflect two fundamental aspects of artistic practice. The copying task assesses fidelity and technical skill, while the creative task evaluates originality and divergence from the reference. This dual-task approach allows for a comprehensive evaluation of how professional training influences both the ability to replicate existing works and to innovate, thereby addressing the study's core hypotheses regarding the advantages of expertise.

#### 3. Development of a Bespoke Platform for the Experiment
A bespoke platform was developed to ensure a controlled and consistent environment for all participants. This platform facilitated the use of a modern text-to-image model, allowing for standardized task execution and data collection. Customization was necessary to tailor the user interface and experience to the specific needs of the study, ensuring that participants could focus on the artistic tasks without technical distractions.

#### 4. Selection of the Text-to-Image Model Used in the Study
The choice of text-to-image model was critical to the study's validity. A state-of-the-art model was selected based on its ability to generate high-quality images that could effectively serve both the copying and creative tasks. The model's performance in generating diverse outputs was essential for accurately assessing the differences between professional artists and laypeople, as well as for comparing human outputs to those generated by AI.

#### 5. Method of Measuring Similarity (Cosine Vector Similarity)
Cosine vector similarity was employed as a quantitative measure to assess the similarity between generated images and reference images. This method is effective in high-dimensional spaces, allowing for a nuanced comparison of image features. By using this metric, the study could objectively evaluate the fidelity of outputs, providing a robust basis for comparing the performance of artists and laypeople.

#### 6. Recruitment Strategy for Professional Artists
The recruitment strategy for professional artists involved leveraging personal and professional networks to ensure that participants met the study's criteria for professional experience. This targeted approach minimized the risk of including non-professionals and ensured a high-quality sample of active artists, which is crucial for the integrity of the comparative analysis.

#### 7. Criteria for Laypeople Selection to Ensure No Professional Art Experience
To maintain a clear distinction between the two groups, laypeople were selected based on strict criteria that excluded individuals with professional art experience. This was achieved through screening questions in the post-questionnaire, ensuring that the layperson sample accurately represented individuals without formal training or experience in visual arts.

#### 8. Payment Structure for Participants
Participants were compensated with a fixed payment of €3.75 for their involvement in the study. This payment structure was designed to comply with ethical guidelines and ensure fair compensation for participants' time and effort, while also being consistent across both groups to avoid any bias in motivation.

#### 9. Language Fluency Requirement for Participants
A requirement for fluency in English was established to ensure that all participants could effectively understand and engage with the tasks involving text prompts. This was crucial for maintaining consistency in the input provided to the AI model and for ensuring that participants could accurately interpret the instructions and reference images.

#### 10. Ethical Considerations and IRB Approval Process
The study underwent a rigorous ethical review process, receiving approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development. This process ensured that the study adhered to ethical standards regarding participant treatment, informed consent, and data privacy, thereby safeguarding the rights and welfare of all participants.

#### 11. Pre-registration of Study Hypotheses
Pre-registration of the study hypotheses was conducted to enhance transparency and rigor in the research process. By publicly documenting the hypotheses prior to data collection, the researchers aimed to mitigate biases and ensure that the analysis remained focused on the pre-defined research questions.

#### 12. Data Analysis Methods Employed
Data analysis involved both quantitative and qualitative methods, including statistical comparisons of image similarity scores and thematic analysis of participant sentiments towards AI. This multi-faceted approach allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the results, addressing both the technical performance of participants and their subjective experiences.

#### 13. Approach to Sentiment Analysis Regarding AI
Sentiment analysis was conducted to gauge participants' attitudes towards AI in the context of artistic creation. This analysis provided insights into how professional artists and laypeople perceive the role of AI in their work, contributing to a broader understanding of the cultural implications of AI in the arts.
