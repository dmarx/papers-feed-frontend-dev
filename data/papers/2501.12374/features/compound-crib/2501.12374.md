### Detailed Technical Explanations/Justifications/Rationale for the Study

#### Study Objective
The primary objective of this study is to investigate how artistic expertise influences the use of generative AI for image creation tasks among professional artists compared to laypeople. This objective is grounded in the increasing prevalence of generative AI tools in creative fields and the need to understand whether traditional artistic skills enhance or hinder the effectiveness of these tools. By focusing on both professional artists and laypeople, the study aims to elucidate the role of expertise in navigating and utilizing AI technologies in artistic practices.

#### Key Hypotheses
1. **H1: Artists' images in the copying task will be closer to the original than laypeople's.**
   - **Rationale**: Professional artists possess a refined understanding of artistic techniques and principles, which likely enables them to replicate images more accurately. This hypothesis is based on the premise that expertise translates into better technical execution.

2. **H2: Artists' images in the creative task will be more distant from the original than laypeople's.**
   - **Rationale**: Artists are trained to think divergently and push creative boundaries, which may lead them to generate images that are more innovative and less similar to the original reference. This hypothesis reflects the expectation that artistic training fosters creativity and originality.

3. **H3: Artists will choose more suitable images in the curation phase compared to laypeople.**
   - **Rationale**: The ability to curate effectively is often linked to a deep understanding of aesthetics and artistic intent. Artists are expected to have a more developed sense of what constitutes a suitable or high-quality image, leading to better curation outcomes.

#### Experimental Design
- **Two Tasks**: The study employs a dual-task design consisting of a **Copying Task** (where participants replicate a reference image) and a **Creative Task** (where participants generate an image that is maximally different from the reference). This design allows for a comprehensive assessment of both fidelity and creativity in image generation.
  
- **Participants**: The study includes 50 professional artists and 49 demographically matched laypeople. This balanced sample size ensures that the findings are robust and that any observed differences can be attributed to expertise rather than demographic variables.

- **Bespoke Platform**: Participants use a custom-built platform that integrates a modern text-to-image model (e.g., Stable Diffusion). This choice of technology is crucial as it reflects the current state-of-the-art in generative AI, allowing for relevant and meaningful comparisons between human outputs and AI-generated images.

#### Data Analysis
- **Cosine Vector Similarity**: The similarity of generated images to the original reference images is quantified using cosine vector similarity based on image embeddings. This method provides a mathematically rigorous way to assess visual similarity, allowing for objective comparisons between the outputs of artists, laypeople, and the AI model.

- **Comparison with GPT-4o**: By including a vision-capable large language model (GPT-4o) in the analysis, the study contextualizes human performance against advanced AI capabilities. This comparison is essential for understanding the relative strengths and weaknesses of human creativity versus AI-generated outputs.

#### Findings
- **Artists vs. Laypeople**: The results indicate that while artists produced more faithful and creative outputs than laypeople, the differences were modest. This finding suggests that while expertise does confer advantages, the gap may not be as pronounced as expected, possibly due to the capabilities of modern generative AI.

- **AI Performance**: GPT-4o's comparable performance in the copying task and superior performance in the creative task raises important questions about the evolving role of AI in creative fields. This finding highlights the potential for AI to augment human creativity rather than simply replace it.

- **Human Outputs**: Despite the strong performance of AI, the best results were still produced by human participants, underscoring the irreplaceable value of human intuition, emotion, and experience in the creative process.

#### Sentiment Analysis
The study also collected sentiments towards AI usage among participants, revealing significant differences in perception between artists and laypeople. This qualitative data adds depth to the quantitative findings, providing insights into how different groups view the integration of AI in creative practices.

#### Implications
The findings emphasize the importance of integrating artistic skills with AI training in educational contexts. As generative AI continues to evolve, there is a pressing need for artists and visual professionals to develop proficiency in both traditional artistic techniques and AI technologies. This dual focus could foster a collaborative synergy that enhances creative output and innovation in the arts.

#### Ethical Considerations
The study addresses the ethical implications of AI in creative professions, including concerns about job displacement and "AI anxiety." By acknowledging these issues, the research contributes to a broader discourse on the future of work in the arts and the need for adaptive strategies in education and professional development.

#### Visual Representation
While the study includes a figure illustrating the motivation and experimental pipeline, the critique regarding the limited number of graphs is valid. More visual data representations could enhance the clarity and impact
