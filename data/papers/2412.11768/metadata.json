  "abstract": "In this work, we question the necessity of adaptive gradient methods for\ntraining deep neural networks. SGD-SaI is a simple yet effective enhancement to\nstochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM). SGD-SaI performs learning\nrate Scaling at Initialization (SaI) to distinct parameter groups, guided by\ntheir respective gradient signal-to-noise ratios (g-SNR). By adjusting learning\nrates without relying on adaptive second-order momentum, SGD-SaI helps prevent\ntraining imbalances from the very first iteration and cuts the optimizer's\nmemory usage by half compared to AdamW. Despite its simplicity and efficiency,\nSGD-SaI consistently matches or outperforms AdamW in training a variety of\nTransformer-based tasks, effectively overcoming a long-standing challenge of\nusing SGD for training Transformers. SGD-SaI excels in ImageNet-1K\nclassification with Vision Transformers(ViT) and GPT-2 pretraining for large\nlanguage models (LLMs, transformer decoder-only), demonstrating robustness to\nhyperparameter variations and practicality for diverse applications. We further\ntested its robustness on tasks like LoRA fine-tuning for LLMs and diffusion\nmodels, where it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers. From a\nmemory efficiency perspective, SGD-SaI achieves substantial memory savings for\noptimizer states, reducing memory usage by 5.93 GB for GPT-2 (1.5B parameters)\nand 25.15 GB for Llama2-7B compared to AdamW in full-precision training\nsettings.",
