- **Objective**: Model a distribution of possible outputs in image-to-image translation, addressing ambiguity in mappings.
  
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Latent Vector**: Low-dimensional representation capturing output variability, sampled at test time.
  - **Bijective Consistency**: Ensures invertibility between latent code and output to prevent mode collapse.

- **Methodology**:
  - **Generator**: Maps input image and latent code to output.
  - **Encoder**: Maps output back to latent space, ensuring non-injective mapping is avoided.

- **Training Objectives**:
  - **cVAE-GAN**: 
    - Encodes ground truth image into latent space.
    - Regularizes latent distribution using KL-divergence to a standard normal distribution.
    - Loss function: 
      \[
      L_{VAE-GAN} = E_{A,B \sim p(A,B)} [\log(D(A, B))] + E_{A,B \sim p(A,B), z \sim E(B)} [\log(1 - D(A, G(A, z)))]
      \]
  - **cLR-GAN**: 
    - Uses randomly drawn latent vector; output may not match ground truth but should be realistic.
  - **BicycleGAN**: 
    - Combines cVAE-GAN and cLR-GAN for improved performance.

- **Loss Functions**:
  - **Adversarial Loss**: 
    \[
    L_{GAN}(G, D) = E_{A,B \sim p(A,B)} [\log(D(A, B))] + E_{A \sim p(A), z \sim p(z)} [\log(1 - D(A, G(A, z)))]
    \]
  - **Image Reconstruction Loss**: 
    \[
    L_{image 1}(G) = E_{A,B \sim p(A,B), z \sim p(z)} ||B - G(A, z)||_1
    \]
  - **Final Loss**: 
    \[
    G^* = \arg \min_G \max_D L_{GAN}(G, D) + \lambda L_{image 1}(G)
    \]

- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - **Photorealism**: Human judgment.
  - **Diversity**: Perceptual distance metric.
