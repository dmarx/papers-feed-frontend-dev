  "abstract": "The prompt spectra of gamma-ray bursts are known to follow broadband\ncontinuum behavior over decades in energy. GRB 221009A, given the moniker the\nbrightest of all time (BOAT), is the brightest gamma-ray burst identified in\nhalf a century of observations, and was first identified by the Fermi Gamma-ray\nBurst Monitor (GBM). On behalf of the Fermi-GBM Team, Lesage et al. (2023)\ndescribed the initial GBM analysis. Ravasio et al. (2024) report the\nidentification of a spectral line in part of the prompt emission of this burst,\nwhich they describe as evolving over 80 s from $\\sim$12 MeV to 6 MeV. We report\na GBM Team analysis on the Ravasio Line: 1) We cannot identify an instrumental\neffect that could have produced this signal, and 2) our method of calculating\nthe statistical significance of the line shows it easily exceeds the 5$\\sigma$\ndiscovery threshold. We additionally comment on the claim of the line beginning\nat earlier time intervals, up to 37 MeV, as reported in Zhang et al. (2024). We\nfind that it is reasonable to utilize these measurements for characterization\nof the line evolution, with caution. We encourage theoretical studies exploring\nthis newly discovered gamma-ray burst spectral feature, unless any rigorous\nalternative explanation unrelated to the emission from GRB 221009A is\nidentified.",
