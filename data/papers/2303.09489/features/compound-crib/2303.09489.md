The SpaceTime architecture represents a significant advancement in time series modeling, addressing key challenges in expressivity, long horizon forecasting, and computational efficiency. Below is a detailed technical explanation of the researchers' decisions regarding the key contributions of SpaceTime.

### Key Contributions of SpaceTime

1. **New State-Space Time Series Architecture**:
   - The introduction of a state-space model (SSM) architecture that integrates deep learning techniques allows for a more expressive representation of time series data. This architecture is designed to overcome limitations found in previous models, particularly in capturing complex dependencies and long-range forecasting.

### Expressivity

- **Companion Matrix Representation**:
  - The use of a companion matrix \( A \) is central to enhancing the expressivity of the model. The companion matrix is a structured representation that allows the SSM to effectively capture autoregressive processes. The specific form of the companion matrix enables the model to represent relationships between current and past observations succinctly.
  
  \[
  A = \begin{bmatrix}
  0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & a_0 \\
  1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & a_1 \\
  0 & 1 & \cdots & 0 & a_2 \\
  \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\
  0 & 0 & \cdots & 1 & a_{d-1}
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]

  - This matrix structure allows the model to recover autoregressive (AR) processes, such as ARIMA and exponential smoothing, which are fundamental in time series analysis. By parameterizing the state matrix in this way, the model can learn the underlying dynamics of the time series data more effectively than previous deep SSMs, which struggled to capture such dependencies.

### Long Horizon Forecasting

- **Closed-Loop SSM Approach**:
  - The introduction of a "closed-loop" SSM approach is a novel strategy that allows the model to generate its own future inputs for forecasting. This is achieved by training the SSM layer to predict the next time-step inputs alongside its outputs. This dual prediction capability enables the model to recursively generate future inputs, facilitating long-term forecasting without relying on external data inputs.

### Efficiency

- **Algorithmic Improvements**:
  - The researchers propose an algorithm that significantly reduces the time and space complexity of SSM computations. By leveraging the structure of the companion matrix, the complexity is reduced from \( \mathcal{O}(d^2) \) to \( \mathcal{O}(d + h) \), where \( d \) is the state size and \( h \) is the input sequence length. This improvement is crucial for handling long sequences efficiently, making the model suitable for real-world applications where data can be extensive.

### Performance Metrics

- **State-of-the-Art Results**:
  - The SpaceTime model achieves impressive performance metrics across various benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness. The model's ability to achieve the best or second-best AUROC on multiple classification tasks and the best MSE on forecasting tasks indicates its robustness and versatility. The significant speedup in training time over traditional models like Transformers and LSTMs further underscores its efficiency.

### Model Structure

- **Multi-Layer Encoder-Decoder Architecture**:
  - The architecture of SpaceTime is designed as a multi-layer encoder-decoder model, where each layer parameterizes multiple SSMs. This layered approach allows for hierarchical learning of time series dynamics, with the last layer serving as the decoder to produce predictions. This structure is conducive to capturing complex temporal patterns and relationships in the data.

### Mathematical Framework

- **State-Space Model Equations**:
  - The mathematical formulation of the SSM is foundational to the model's operation. The equations governing the state transitions and output generation are:

  \[
  x_{k+1} = Ax_k + Bu_k
  \]
  \[
  y_k = Cx_k + Du_k
  \]

  - By treating the input \( u \) and output \( y \) as copies of the same process, the model can effectively learn the dynamics of time series data, allowing for accurate predictions.

### Proposition 1

- **Generalizability of the Companion Matrix**:
  - The researchers demonstrate that the companion state matrix SSM can represent a wide range of time series processes, enhancing the model's applicability across different domains. This generalizability is a key advantage, allowing the model to be used in various contexts beyond those it was explicitly trained on.

### Training Methodology

- **Neural Network Parameterization**:
  - The training methodology involves parameterizing the companion SSM within neural network layers, enabling efficient learning of the underlying parameters for multiple time series processes. This approach allows the model to adapt to different types of time series data while maintaining computational efficiency.

### Benchmarking

- **Robust Evaluation**:
