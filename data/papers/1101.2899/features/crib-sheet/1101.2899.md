- **Definition of Critical Transitions**: Abrupt changes in dynamical systems, characterized by rapid qualitative changes and crossing special thresholds.

- **Key Characteristics of Critical Transitions**:
  1. Abrupt qualitative change.
  2. Rapid occurrence compared to regular dynamics.
  3. Crossing a threshold.
  4. New state is far from the previous state.
  5. Small noise in the system (deterministic component with small random fluctuations).

- **Early-Warning Signs**:
  - **Slowing Down**: System recovers slowly from perturbations.
  - **Increasing Variance**: Variance increases as the transition approaches.
  - **Asymmetric Fluctuations**: Noisy fluctuations become more asymmetric.
  - **Increased Autocorrelation**: Autocorrelation increases before a transition.

- **Mathematical Framework**:
  - **Bifurcation Theory**: Classifies qualitative transitions under parameter variation.
  - **Fast-Slow Systems**: Defined by the equations:
    - \( \frac{dx}{dt} = f(x, y) \)
    - \( \frac{dy}{dt} = 0 \)
  - **Inclusion of Slow Parameters**: 
    - \( \frac{dx}{dt} = f(x, y) \)
    - \( \frac{dy}{dt} = \epsilon g(x, y) \) where \( 0 < \epsilon \ll 1 \).

- **Fast-Slow System Dynamics**:
  - Transition to slow time scale:
    - \( \frac{dx}{d\tau} = f(x, y) \)
    - \( \frac{dy}{d\tau} = g(x, y) \)
  - **Critical Set**: Defined as \( C = \{(x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^{m+n} : f(x, y) = 0\} \).

- **Fenichel's Theorem**: Describes dynamics for normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds:
  - For compact normally hyperbolic submanifold \( S_0 \):
    - There exists a locally invariant manifold \( S_\epsilon \) that converges to the slow flow as \( \epsilon \to 0 \).

- **Stochastic Dynamics**:
  - Incorporation of noise into fast-slow systems.
  - Stochastic bifurcation theory and its implications for critical transitions.

- **Numerical Simulations**: Used to validate theoretical results and analyze variance and autocorrelation as indicators of transitions.

- **Future Directions**: Suggestions for further research in the mathematical theory of critical transitions, including the exploration of stochastic effects and their implications.
