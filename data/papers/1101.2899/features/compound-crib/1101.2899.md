The researchers' decisions regarding the definition and analysis of critical transitions in dynamical systems are grounded in a robust mathematical framework that integrates concepts from bifurcation theory, fast-slow systems, and stochastic dynamics. Below is a detailed technical explanation of their rationale:

### Definition of Critical Transitions

**Critical Transitions** are defined as abrupt changes in dynamical systems, characterized by rapid qualitative changes and the crossing of special thresholds. This definition is crucial because it encapsulates the essence of phenomena observed in various fields, such as ecology, medicine, finance, and climate science. The researchers emphasize the need for a precise mathematical characterization to facilitate the identification and prediction of these transitions.

### Key Characteristics of Critical Transitions

1. **Abrupt Qualitative Change**: This characteristic highlights that critical transitions are not gradual but involve sudden shifts in system behavior. This is essential for distinguishing critical transitions from regular dynamics.

2. **Rapid Occurrence**: The speed of the transition relative to the system's normal dynamics is a key feature. This rapidity is often what makes these transitions particularly impactful and difficult to predict.

3. **Crossing a Threshold**: The notion of a threshold is fundamental in dynamical systems, as it marks the point at which the system's behavior changes qualitatively. This aligns with the concept of bifurcations in mathematical theory, where small changes in parameters can lead to significant shifts in system dynamics.

4. **New State Far from Previous State**: This characteristic underscores the potential for critical transitions to lead to states that are fundamentally different from previous conditions, which is particularly relevant in ecological and climate contexts.

5. **Small Noise in the System**: The assumption of small noise allows for the application of deterministic models while acknowledging that real-world systems often experience random fluctuations. This is important for developing predictive models that can account for variability in system behavior.

### Early-Warning Signs

The researchers identify several early-warning signs that can indicate an impending critical transition:

- **Slowing Down**: This phenomenon, where the system takes longer to recover from perturbations, is indicative of a system approaching a tipping point. It suggests that the system's resilience is diminishing.

- **Increasing Variance**: As the transition nears, the variance in the system's behavior increases, reflecting growing uncertainty and instability.

- **Asymmetric Fluctuations**: The emergence of asymmetry in fluctuations can signal that the system is no longer behaving symmetrically, which is often a precursor to a critical transition.

- **Increased Autocorrelation**: Higher autocorrelation indicates that past states of the system are becoming more predictive of future states, suggesting a buildup of conditions conducive to a transition.

### Mathematical Framework

The researchers employ a mathematical framework that includes:

- **Bifurcation Theory**: This theory provides a systematic way to classify qualitative changes in dynamical systems as parameters vary. It is foundational for understanding how critical transitions can arise from small changes in system parameters.

- **Fast-Slow Systems**: The use of fast-slow systems allows for the modeling of dynamics where different components of the system evolve on different time scales. This is particularly relevant for critical transitions, as it captures the interplay between rapid changes and slower underlying processes.

- **Inclusion of Slow Parameters**: By incorporating slow parameters into the system's equations, the researchers can model how gradual changes can lead to abrupt transitions, aligning with the observed characteristics of critical transitions.

### Fast-Slow System Dynamics

The transition to a slow time scale is formalized through equations that describe the dynamics of fast and slow variables. The critical set, defined as the set of equilibria for the fast subsystem, is central to understanding the behavior of the system near critical transitions.

### Fenichel's Theorem

Fenichel's Theorem is pivotal in describing the dynamics of normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds. It ensures that for small perturbations, the dynamics near the critical manifold can be approximated, allowing for a clearer understanding of how transitions occur.

### Stochastic Dynamics

The incorporation of noise into fast-slow systems acknowledges the reality of stochastic influences in many natural systems. Stochastic bifurcation theory is explored to understand how randomness can affect critical transitions, providing a more comprehensive view of system behavior.

### Numerical Simulations

Numerical simulations serve as a vital tool for validating theoretical predictions and analyzing early-warning signs. They allow researchers to explore the dynamics of critical transitions in a controlled environment, providing insights that can be difficult to obtain analytically.

### Future Directions

The researchers suggest that future work should focus on further developing the mathematical theory of critical transitions, particularly in the context of stochastic effects. This includes exploring how noise influences the dynamics of transitions and refining early-warning indicators.

### Conclusion

In summary, the researchers' decisions regarding the definition and analysis of critical transitions are deeply rooted in a mathematical framework that integrates various theories and concepts. This approach not only enhances the understanding of critical transitions but also provides practical tools for predicting and managing these phenomena in real-world systems.
