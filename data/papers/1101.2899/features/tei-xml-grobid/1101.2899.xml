<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Bifurcations can cause dynamical systems with slowly varying parameters to transition to far-away attractors. The terms "critical transition" or "tipping point" have been used to describe this situation. Critical transitions have been observed in an astonishingly diverse set of applications from ecosystems and climate change to medicine and finance. The main goal of this paper is to give an overview which standard mathematical theories can be applied to critical transitions. We shall focus on early-warning signs that have been suggested to predict critical transitions and point out what mathematical theory can provide in this context. Starting from classical bifurcation theory and incorporating multiple time scale dynamics one can give a detailed analysis of local bifurcations that induce critical transitions. We suggest that the mathematical theory of fast-slow systems provides a natural definition of critical transitions. Since noise often plays a crucial role near critical transitions the next step is to consider stochastic fast-slow systems. The interplay between sample path techniques, partial differential equations and random dynamical systems is highlighted. Each viewpoint provides potential early-warning signs for critical transitions. Since increasing variance has been suggested as an early-warning sign we examine it in the context of normal forms analytically, numerically and geometrically; we also consider autocorrelation numerically. Hence we demonstrate the applicability of early-warning signs for generic models. We end with suggestions for future directions of the theory.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In this paper "critical transitions" or "tipping points" are viewed from the perspective of dynamical systems. Our aim is to point out that various observations, assumptions and ideas developed in diverse scientific disciplines can be expressed naturally using standard mathematical theory. In particular, we hope that this paper can be viewed as a mathematical complement to the excellent review by Scheffer et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>. A non-mathematical working definition of a critical transition is an abrupt change in a dynamical system. To illustrate the concept we list four examples</p><p>• In ecosystems rapid changes to desertification or extinctions of species can occur <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77]</ref>.</p><p>• Medical conditions can quickly change from regular to irregular behavior; examples are asthma attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref> or epileptic seizures <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>.</p><p>• Financial markets can transition from a balanced market to a financial crisis <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>.</p><p>• Changes in the climate and its constituent subsystems can occur abruptly <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1]</ref>.</p><p>It is clear that we would like to understand and predict these phenomena. At first glance it might be surprising that all four examples have anything in common as they arise in completely different contexts and situations. Nevertheless, it has become apparent that critical transitions share several attributes <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75]</ref>:</p><p>(1) An abrupt qualitative change in the dynamical system occurs.</p><p>(2) The change occurs rapidly in comparison to the regular dynamics.</p><p>(3) The system crosses a special threshold near a transition. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> The new state of the system is far away from its previous state. Furthermore, significant progress has been made in predicting a critical transition before it occurs. The goal is to infer from previous data when a catastrophic shift in the dynamics is going to occur. Ideally we would like to have a comprehensive list of early-warning signs. A variety of system-specific criteria could be introduced; but we are more interested in generic indicators that are expected to be applicable to large classes of transitions. The following assumption will be of major importance <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref> (5) There is small noise in the system i.e. the data has a major deterministic component with small "random fluctuations".</p><p>There are several characteristics that have been observed in systems before critical transitions. We shall only list a few of them here: <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> The system recovers slowly from perturbations ("slowing down"). <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> The variance of the system increases as the transition is approached. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> The noisy fluctuations become more asymmetric. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> The autocorrelation increases before a transition.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows time series with critical transitions; the times series have been generated by simulating two generic models discussed in Sections 7-9 for the fast-slow fold and transcritical bifurcations. Many natural questions arise regarding analysis and comparison of these two time series. The observations (1)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> are extremely important for this purpose. However, it is desirable to embed these observations into a mathematically precise description of the system dynamics and to identify them in generic models. Relations to bifurcation theory and some indicators have been partially analyzed using statistical techniques such as autoregressive models The time series for the generic models we propose resemble time series from experiments. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>.</p><p>The major goal of the current paper is to argue that the observations (1)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>, that are usually made in applications, should be understood from a mathematical viewpoint by using deterministic and stochastic multiscale dynamical systems. We shall try to provide an overview which mathematical concepts and tools can be used to develop a theory of critical transitions. The natural starting point is bifurcation theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref> and in this respect our approach is closest to recent work by Sieber and Thompson <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84]</ref> that realizes the need for a detailed bifurcation-theoretic analysis of tipping points. Given a dynamical system, such as a differential equation or iterated map, bifurcation theory can be used to classify qualitative transitions under the variation of parameters. It has been successfully applied in fields ranging from physics, engineering and chemistry to modern developments in neuroscience and mathematical biology <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>. Here we shall focus on differential equations to simplify the discussion but remark that discrete time systems can also be studied from this perspective. As a second step we introduce stochasticity into the dynamics. Our approach is closest to the work by Berglund and Gentz <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>; they demonstrated the applicability of stochastic multiscale differential equations in a variety of contexts such as climate modeling and neuroscience. Here we point out what their approach implies for critical transitions. We also use numerical simulation of "normalform"-type models and compare our results to theoretic results obtained from Fokker-Planck equations. Our numerical approach can also provide benchmark data for time series analysis methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>. The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we explain why the differential equations describing critical transitions should have multiple time scales. The focus will be on two scales described by a fast-slow system. We suggest that fast-slow systems theory provides a natural definition for a critical transition and check that certain bifurcations satisfy this definition. Furthermore we review the basic calculation for "slowing down" and point that slowing down differs for different types of critical transitions. In Section 3 we review the concept of normal hyperbolicity that separates regular fast-slow system dynamics from dynamic bifurcations; the application in the context of critical transitions is indicated. In Section 4 we recall some basic tools and viewpoints in stochastic analysis. Stochastic fast-slow systems are introduced and some recent results are stated. The case of a fast-slow stochastic system away from a critical transition is defined and its properties are investigated; this provides a comparative method to detect transitions and also to estimate system parameters. In Section 5 we review recent progress in stochastic bifurcation theory and show how this theory should apply to and interact with a critical transition involving noise. The concept of stochastic bifurcation is much less developed. However, we introduce an example that shows that so-called P-bifurcations can be early-warning signs. In Section 6 noise-induced phenomena are discussed that have recently been discovered in many mathematical models. The prediction of critical transitions is more complicated in this context and a numerical example illustrates this point. In Section 7 we consider critical transitions under the simplest mathematical assumptions. We calculate the variance of distributions of trajectories near a stochastic critical transition point using a Fokker-Planck approach. In Section 8 we use numerical simulations to expand on our modeling approach and we discuss the variance as an indicator if only a single sample path is available. Section 9 extends the numerical simulation approach to autocorrelation. Section 10 concludes the paper with a discussion of the current state of the theory and a discussion of topics we omitted. We also sketch some directions for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Fast-Slow Systems I: Critical Transitions</head><p>We start with the deterministic theory. Our first goal is to make the term "critical transition" mathematically more precise. Consider the parametrized family of ordinary differential equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">dx dt = x ′ = f (x; y)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where x ∈ R m are phase space variables and y ∈ R m represent parameters. A general statement that can often be found in the description of critical transitions in applications is that "a parameter evolves slowly until the tipping point is reached". Therefore it is a natural approach to include the parameters into the original differential equation. The parametrized family (1) can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">x ′ = f (x, y), y ′ = 0. (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">)</formula><p>Using (2) it is easy to incorporate slowly varying parameters by adding a slow evolution to y</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">x ′ = f (x, y), y ′ = ǫg(x, y),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where 0 &lt; ǫ ≪ 1 is a small parameter and g is assumed to be sufficiently smooth. In many cases it suffices to assume that the parameter dynamics is de-coupled from phase space dynamics and one assumes g ≡ 1. The ODEs (3) form a fast-slow system where the variables x ∈ R m are the fast variables and y ∈ R m are the slow variables. The parameter ǫ describes the time scale separation. We point out that the "inclusion of dynamic slow parameters" is entirely standard and well-known in the theory of multiple time scale dynamics.</p><p>Remark: A new introductory book to fast-slow systems is currently being written <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. The book is going to include the deterministic theory as well as numerical and stochastic components that are relevant in Sections 4-8. Classical references for deterministic fast-slow systems are <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. In the current paper we restrict ourselves to review the necessary definitions and concepts that can directly be applied to critical transitions. Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">3</ref>) can be re-written by changing from the fast time scale t to the slow time scale τ = ǫt ǫ dx dτ = ǫ ẋ = f (x, y),</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">dy dτ = ẏ = g(x, y).<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The first step to analyze a fast-slow system is to consider the singular limit ǫ → 0. In the formulation (3) this yields the parametrized family (2) which is also known as the fast subsystem or layer equations. Considering the singular limit in (4) gives the slow subsystem or reduced system 0 = f (x, y), ẏ = g(x, y).</p><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">)<label>5</label></formula><p>The associated subsystem flows are naturally called the fast flow and the slow flow. Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">5</ref>) is a differential-algebraic equation so that the slow flow is constrained to</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">C = {(x, y) ∈ R m+n : f (x, y) = 0}.</formula><p>The set C is called the critical set or the critical manifold if C is manifold. The points in C are equilibria for the fast subsystem (2). C is normally hyperbolic at p ∈ R m+n if the matrix (D x f )(p) is hyperbolic i.e. all its eigenvalues have non-zero real parts. If all eigenvalues have negative/positive real parts then C is attracting/repelling at p; if C is normally hyperbolic and neither attracting nor repelling we say it is of saddle-type. For a normally hyperbolic critical manifold the implicit function theorem gives</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">C = {(x, y) ∈ R m+n : h 0 (y) = x}</formula><p>where h 0 : R n → R m satisfies f (h 0 (y), y) = 0. Then the slow flow can be written as ẏ = g(h 0 (y), y).</p><p>Fenichel's Theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">88,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">85]</ref> provides a complete description of the dynamics for normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds.</p><p>Theorem 2.1 (Fenichel's Theorem). Suppose S = S 0 is a compact normally hyperbolic submanifold (possibly with boundary) of the critical manifold C. Then for ǫ &gt; 0 sufficiently small there exists a locally invariant manifold S ǫ diffeomorphic to S 0 . S ǫ has a Hausdorff distance of O(ǫ) from S 0 and the flow on S ǫ converges to the slow flow as ǫ → 0.</p><p>S ǫ is called a slow manifold. Different slow manifolds S ǫ lie at a distance O(e -K/ǫ ) from each other and so we will often simply refer to "the" slow manifold as the choice of representative is irrelevant for many asymptotic results. A normally hyperbolic critical manifold C 0 has associated local stable and unstable manifolds</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">W s (C 0 ) = p∈C 0 W s (p),</formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">W u (C 0 ) = p∈C 0 W u (p),</formula><p>where W s (p) and W u (p) are the local stable and unstable manifolds of p as a hyperbolic equilibrium of the fast subsystem. These manifolds also persist for ǫ &gt; 0 sufficiently small. In addition to Fenichel's Theorem there are coordinate changes that simplify a fast-slow system considerably near a critical manifold <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref> if the slow flow has no bounded invariant sets.</p><p>Theorem 2.2 (Fenichel Normal Form). Suppose S 0 is a compact normally hyperbolic submanifold of C with m u unstable and m s stable fast directions and that the slow flow is rectifiable on S 0 . Then there exists a smooth invertible coordinate change (x, y) → (a, b, v) ∈ R mu × R ms × R n so that a fast-slow system (3) can be written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">a ′ = Λ(a, b, v, ǫ)a, b ′ = Γ(a, b, v, ǫ)b, (6) v ′ = ǫ(e 1 + H(a, b, v, ǫ)ab),</formula><p>where Λ, Γ are matrix-valued functions. Λ has m u positive and Γ has m u negative eigenvalues, e 1 = (1, 0, . . . , 0) T ∈ R n is a unit vector and H is bilinear in a, b.</p><p>The manifold S 0 perturbs to a slow manifold S ǫ by Fenichel's Theorem. Then this slow manifold is "straightened" together with its stable and unstable manifolds that become coordinate planes <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Therefore we can basically assume that the fast subsystem near a normally hyperbolic critical manifold is linear with eigendirections aligning with the coordinates. This will provide the basis for our discussion of dynamical behavior far away from critical transition points. The next classical example illustrates the definitions and shows how normal hyperbolicity can fail.</p><p>Example 2.3. Consider a planar fast-slow system modeling a fold bifurcation with slow parameter drift <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">ǫ ẋ = -y -x 2 , ẏ = 1.<label>(7)</label></formula><p>The critical manifold C = {(x, y) ∈ R 2 : y = -x 2 } is normally hyperbolic away from the fold bifurcation point (x, y) = (0, 0) of the fast subsystem; the point (0, 0) ∈ C is also refered to as a fold point. Observe that the set C a := C ∩ {x &gt; 0} are attracting equilibrium points for the fast subsystem while points on C r := C ∩ {x &lt; 0} are repelling; see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. To derive an expression for the slow flow one can differentiate y = -x 2 implicitly with respect to τ giving ẏ = -2x ẋ which yields ẋ = -1 2x .</p><p>Note that the slow flow is not well-defined at x = 0. However, by rescaling of time τ → 2xτ , which reverses the direction of trajectories on C r , the slow flow can be desingularized. The flow of ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">7</ref>) for ǫ = 0 can be described by combining trajectories of the fast and slow subsystems; see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>(a). A solution starting in W s (C a ) approaches it rapidly, then it follows the slow flow on C and finally "jumps" at the fold bifurcation point toward x = -∞. Recall that assumption (1) in Section 1 requires a critical transition to occur at a point when there is a sudden change from slow dynamics to a fast repelling segment. To make this idea more precise we recall one more definition from fast-slow systems. In the singular limit ǫ = 0 trajectories can be considered as concatenations of trajectory segments of the fast and slow subsystems. A candidate <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref> is defined as a homeomorphic image γ 0 (t) of a real interval (a, b) with a &lt; b where</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">• the interval is partitioned as a = t 0 &lt; t 1 &lt; • • • &lt; t m = b,</formula><p>• the image of each subinterval γ 0 (t j-1 , t j ) is a trajectory of either the fast or the slow subsystem,</p><p>• and the image γ 0 (a, b) has an orientation that is consistent with the orientations on each subinterval γ 0 (t j-1 , t j ) induced by the fast and slow flows.</p><p>Note that we can also view a candidate as a trajectory of a hybrid system. If consecutive images γ 0 (t j-1 , t j ) and γ 0 (t j , t j+1 ) are trajectories for different subsystems, i.e. there is a transition at t j from fast to slow or from slow to fast, then we say that γ 0 (t j ) is a transition point. Using candidates and transition points we can easily give a rigorous definition of critical transitions.</p><p>Definition 2.4. Let p = (x p , y p ) ∈ C be a point where the critical manifold C is not normally hyperbolic. We say that p is a critical transition if there is a candidate γ 0 so that (C1) γ 0 (t j-1 , t j ) is a normally hyperbolic attracting submanifold of C, (C2) p = γ 0 (t j ) is a transition point, (C3) and γ 0 (t j-1 , t j ) is oriented from γ 0 (t j-1 ) to γ 0 (t j ).</p><p>From a fast-slow systems perspective a critical transition occurs at a bifurcation point y = y p of the fast subsystem that induces switching from a stable slow motion to a fast motion. Definition 2.4 can easily be generalized to more complicated invariant sets of the fast subsystem. For example, if p is a point that lies on a family of fast subsystem periodic orbits we can again define a slow flow by averaging over the periodic orbit <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. Then the same definition applies. The next steps are straightforward checks whether several classical bifurcations are critical transitions. From now on we shall restrict ourselves to the case n = 1 reflecting slow variation of one parameter; without loss of generality we can assume that the bifurcation point of the fast subsystem is located at (x, y) = (0, 0) and we assume that g ≡ 1 near the origin to simplify the exposition (in principle we will only need that g(x, y) ≥ K &gt; 0 near the origin for some constant K independent of (x, y)).</p><p>Proposition 2.5. Suppose m = 1 so that (1) is 1-dimensional and that there is a generic fold (or saddle-node) bifurcation at y = 0. Then the fold bifurcation is also a critical transition.</p><p>Proof. Near a generic fold bifurcation the flow is topologically conjugate to the normal form <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> of a fold bifurcation</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">x ′ = -y -x 2 , y ′ = ǫ.</formula><p>The critical manifold is C = {y = -x 2 } and C a := C ∩ {x &gt; 0} is normally hyperbolic and attracting. Then the candidate</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">γ 0 = C a ∪ {[0, -∞), ×{0}}</formula><p>shows that the fold bifurcation is a critical transition.</p><p>The main idea for the fold bifurcation and all the other bifurcations discussed below is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>.</p><p>Proposition 2.6. Suppose m = 2 so that (1) is a planar system. Suppose there is a generic Hopf bifurcation of the fast subsystem at y = 0 with first Lyapunov coefficient l 1 = 0. The Hopf bifurcation is a critical transition if it is subcritical (l 1 &gt; 0). If it is supercritical (l 1 &lt; 0) then the transition is not critical.</p><p>Proof. By genericity of the Hopf bifurcation we can consider the normal form</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">x ′ 1 = yx 1 -x 2 + l 1 x 1 (x 2 1 + x 2 2 ), x ′ 2 = x 1 + yx 2 + l 1 x 2 (x 2 1 + x 2 2 ), y ′ = ǫ. (<label>8</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">)</formula><p>The equilibrium point x * = 0 of the fast subsystem is stable for y &lt; 0 and loses stability at y = 0 as a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues of (D x f )(0, y) passes through the imaginary axis at y = 0. Suppose first that l 1 &gt; 0 and consider the candidate</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">γ 0 = {x = 0, y &lt; 0} ∪ S</formula><p>where S is a spiral trajectory lying in fast subsystem unstable manifold of (x 1 , x 2 ) = (0, 0) at y = 0; this concludes the first part of the proof. If l 1 &lt; 0 then the fast subsystem Hopf bifurcation is supercritical so that there are stable periodic orbits of amplitude √ y for y &gt; 0. Suppose there exists a candidate γ 0 through (x, y) = (0, 0) that satisfies (C1)-(C3) with γ 0 (t j ) = (0, 0). Note that by (C1) we must have that γ 0 (t j-1 , t j ) is contained in {y &lt; 0, x 1 = 0 = x 2 }. By (C2) we note that γ 0 (t j , t j+1 ) cannot be contained in the bifurcating family of periodic orbits or in {y &gt; 0, x 1 = 0 = x 2 }. Since (0, 0) = (x 1 , x 2 ) is asymptotically stable as an equilibrium point for the fast subsystem we can conclude that (C2) can never be satisfied for any candidate.</p><p>The fold and Hopf bifurcations are the only generic bifurcations occurring in one-parameter families of equilibrium points of flows <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. Under additional assumptions on the structure of the equations (e.g. assuming symmetries) one also often considers the following two one-parameter bifurcations:</p><p>x</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">′ = yx + αx 3 pitchfork bifurcation, x ′ = yx -x 2 transcritical bifurcation.</formula><p>The analysis of the pitchfork bifurcation is completely analogous to the Hopf bifurcation case. Indeed, recall that the Hopf normal form (8) can be transformed into polar coordinates (r, θ) ∈ (R + , S 1 )</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">r ′ = yr + l 1 r 3 , θ ′ = 1.</formula><p>Proposition 2.7. The pitchfork bifurcation is a critical transition when it is subcritical (α &gt; 0) and it is not a critical transition if it is supercritical (α &lt; 0).</p><p>The transcritical bifurcation case is slightly more interesting.</p><p>Proposition 2.8. The transcritical bifurcation is a critical transition.</p><p>Proof. We can again work with the normal form. Consider the candidate</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">γ 0 = {x = 0, y &lt; 0} ∪ {x &lt; 0, y = 0}</formula><p>which shows that we have a critical transition.</p><p>Note carefully that there is a candidate trajectory for the transcritical case that has (0, 0) as a transition point but that does not satisfy (C1). In particular, not all fast segments escape at a critical transition. Furthermore, the assumption that g = 0 near the origin does suffice to make the transcritical bifurcation a critical transition. The fast-slow structure naturally suggests additional quantitative measures for critical transitions; see e.g. Definitions 2.9 and 3.1 below. Furthermore our definition can easily be extended to any possible bifurcation scenario in a fast-slow system including higher codimension bifurcations and global bifurcations e.g. the lists of bifurcations in <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref> can be subsumed into a fast-slow systems framework.</p><p>Critical slowing down is an indicator of how far we are away from a critical transition point <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref>. Recall that if we have a stable solution point X = X(t) for ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) and want to consider the evolution of perturbations X + u for u sufficiently small then</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">u ′ = f (X + u) -f (X) ≈ (D x f )(X)u<label>(9)</label></formula><p>which is the usual variational equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. It can be used to describe how quickly a perturbation of an asymptotically stable equilibrium point will decay to zero.</p><p>Definition 2.9. For (x, y) in the attracting sheet C a of the critical manifold, perturbations z = (x + u, y) decay to (x, y) at an exponential rate exp(λ u ). Note that λ u &lt; 0 is negative; it is called the Lyapunov exponent of z. The largest Lyapunov exponent has smallest magnitude and is called the leading Lyapunov exponent. If the leading Lyapunov exponent of (x, y) ∈ C a is O(y α ) then we suggest to call α the recovery exponent.</p><p>The exponent α provides a measure how quickly perturbations in the fast direction will decay near a bifurcation depending on the distance in parameter space to the critical transition. A larger α indicates slower decay. The recovery exponent can easily be calculated for the four bifurcations discussed above.</p><p>Proposition 2.10.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Fast-Slow Systems II: Dynamic Bifurcation</head><p>In the previous section we have seen that fast-slow systems provide a structural view on critical transitions. The slow change of the parameter drives the system toward a fast subsystem bifurcation at which a rapid transition occurs. We suggest to quantify the fast-slow critical transitions further. Basically l i (p) is the distance to the closest fast subsystem attractor we can jump to by starting at a critical transition while l s (p) measures the distance to the most distant attractor. In Example (2.3) we have l i (0, 0) = ∞ = l s (0, 0); the same holds for normal forms of subcritical Hopf and pitchfork bifurcations. However, it is interesting to note that for the transcritical bifurcation we have l i = 0 and l s = ∞. We can use l i,s (p) to quantify what we described in Section 1 as "jumping to a far-away attractor".</p><p>The theory of fast-slow systems provides a description of the flow near a fold critical transition for the full system with 0 &lt; ǫ ≪ 1.

Pitchfork and transcritical transitions are treated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. The delay effect shifts the critical transition in a slowly varying parameter space from y = 0 to y ≈ y r &gt; 0. For y &lt; 0 we can predict that a critical transition is going to occur by critical slowing down; alternatively, for y &gt; 0 we could also observe perturbations growing exponentially. In particular, if we know ǫ, y a and the type of the critical transition then we can use the theory of bifurcation delay (or dynamic bifurcation) to predict y r accurately. Let us point out that it is a key new observation that the delay effect has to be incorporated in the prediction of critical transitions and that it can potentially be useful to find early-warning signs. </p></div>

In particular, there is no need to refer to heuristic arguments or autoregressive models as one can directly prove this result pathwise.</p><p>• The noise in the slow variable is of higher-order in the drift term of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. In the diffusion term we have noise contributions σ f / √ ǫ and σ g so that if σ f and σ g have the same asymptotic dependence on ǫ we can again neglect the slow variable noise; hence we shall only consider the case σ g = 0 from now on.</p><p>Motivated by the previous discussion and Fenichel's Normal Form Theorem 2.2 we are going to model paths away from a critical transition by the system</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">dx τ = α ǫ (-x)dτ + σ √ ǫ dW τ , dy τ = 1dτ,<label>(22)</label></formula><p>which decouples with y τ = y 0 + τ and where 0 &lt; α = O(1).

The expectation and autocorrelation vanish in the limit τ → ∞ and also all other moments are constants.</p><p>Furthermore our normal form approach also suggests a way how to estimate the parameters from a single sample path. First we detrend the fast variable data in a sufficiently long normally hyperbolic phase. Using the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> for the fast dynamics gives</p><formula xml:id="formula_55">dx τ = -αx dτ + σ dW τ<label>(25)</label></formula><p>where α := α/ǫ and σ = σ/ √ ǫ. Well-known statistical techniques for parameter estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref> can then be applied to <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> to find α and σ from the detrended data; for example, by using a maximum likelihood estimator or many other possible estimators <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. This provides the correct order of magnitude for ǫ from α since α = O(1) by assumption. Then we can conclude the order of σ from σ. This shows that the initial data far away from a critical transition can have crucial value for its prediction. Note however, that we have assumed that detrending transforms the system into Fenichel normal form. The following example shows the problems that can result in this context. Example 4.2. We have assumed that the fast-slow SDE <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> is already in Fenichel normal form. In general, we only have the equation for the deterministic critical manifold C = {(x, y) ∈ R 2 : f (x, y) = 0}. We can describe C as a graph h : R → R so that</p><formula xml:id="formula_56">C = {(x, y) ∈ R 2 : x = h(y)}</formula><p>where f (h(y), y) = 0. Then the coordinate change X = xh(y) gives that in the new coordinates C = {X = 0}. Let us consider the following example dx t = (yx)dt + σdW t , dy t = ǫg(x, y)dt.</p><p>We set (X t , Y t ) = (x ty t , y t ) which transforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> to</p><formula xml:id="formula_58">dX t = -x -ǫg(X + Y, Y )dt + σdW t , dY t = ǫg(X + Y, Y )dt.</formula><p>Then the variance of x t and X t are equal since Var(X t ) = Var(x ty t ) = Var(x t ) + Var(y t ) -2Cov(x t , y t ) = Var(x t ) since y t was assumed to be deterministic. In general, this cannot be assumed so that stochastic slow variables definitely will change the result; see also equation ( <ref type="formula">18</ref>).</p><p>Hence we have identified the problem of coordinate transformation effects on critical transition indicators as a topic for future study. We are not going to consider this problem here but point out it arises immediately as a key problem once a mathematical framework for critical transitions is considered. Even without the parameter estimation problem in a normally hyperbolic regime away from the transition we must consider this problem; indeed, we might want to assume for theoretical analysis that systems are in normal form near the critical transition point.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Stochastic Indicators</head><p>A natural question for finding indicators of critical transitions for SDEs is to ask what happens to the deterministic fold, Hopf, transcritical and pitchfork bifurcations under the influence of noise. This question already raises a few unanswered mathematical problems of stochastic bifurcation theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. We briefly review two viewpoints about what a "stochastic bifurcation" should be. Suppose we are given a family of random dynamical systems (RDS) {Θ y } for a parameter y ∈ R associated to the SDE <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. Assume that {µ y } is a family of invariant measures for the RDS which can be viewed as analogs for invariant sets in the deterministic case; for example, if the family of RDS has an equilibrium point at z = 0 then µ y = δ 0 is a natural example. We say y = y D is a dynamical or D-bifurcation point if in each neighborhood of y D there is a family of invariant measures ν y such that ν y = µ y and ν y → µ y as y → y D in the topology of weak convergence. Basically this notion presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> tries to capture the deterministic viewpoint of bifurcations in a stochastic context. Instead of "qualitative changes" for invariant measures one could also look at "qualitative changes" for densities associated to the SDE <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.

In Section 5 we observed that the random dynamical system induced by the SDE (39) is described by limiting its domain to points which do not escape. We eliminate the random boundaries and consider the unstable equilibria (i.e. the repelling parts of the critical manifold) as boundaries. Furthermore, our choice of reflecting boundaries enforces the condition that transitions only occur after the deterministic critical transition. We get the following stationary densities</p><formula xml:id="formula_92">fold p y s,1 (x) = 1 N 1 exp 2 σ 2 -yx -1 3 x 3 + 2 3 (-y) 3/2 , transcritical p y s,2 (x) = 1 N 2 exp 2 σ 2 1 2 yx 2 -1 3 x 3 -1 6 y 3 , pitchfork p y s,3 (x) = 1 N 3 exp 2 σ 2 1 2 yx 2 + 1 4 x 4 + 1 4 y 2 .

However, the density for the pitchfork transition is still Z 2 -symmetric with respect to x → -x. Furthermore there are no P-bifurcations for any p y s,j (x) for y &lt; 0 and j = 1, 2, 3.

Starting from y ≪ -1 the variance is almost constant, then we see that for all three cases there is a clearly visible rapid increase in the variance as the deterministic critical transition is approached. However, due to the reflecting boundary conditions we have chosen for the singular limit Fokker-Planck equation, the variance decreases again near y = 0.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref> shows the variance of each distribution as a function of the parameter y for a given fixed noise σ = 0.1. Starting the parameter from y ≪ -1 and increasing it, we see that for all critical transitions there is a rapid increase in the variance as the deterministic critical transition is approached. This confirms the observations and predictions from Section 1 for our normal form SDE models. However, we also observe that there are local maxima for each curve as we increase y further. The local maxima are caused by our modeling approach using the reflecting boundaries; the density becomes more and more confined near the stable critical manifold as we approach y = 0. Note that this does not contradict results using a sample paths approach as for sample paths the scaling of the variance is calculated without boundaries at unstable equilibrium points and for ǫ &gt; 0. Another interesting conjecture from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref> is that the additional local maxima that we have obtained using reflecting boundaries can be viewed as the locations where a linearized approximation fails. More precisely, when y ≪ -1 then we are in a normally hyperbolic regime and linearization and results about OU-process are applicable. When we get closer to the critical transition, nonlinear effects and noise-induced phenomena have to be taken into account. Furthermore it is easily calculated from the formulas (44) that the local maxima of the variance move closer to the critical transition if we decrease the noise level. This shows that by choosing boundary conditions for the Fokker-Planck equation we not only guarantee the existence of a normalizable density in the singular limit but also obtain additional information about critical transitions by identifying an easily-to-calculate indicator ("the local maximum") beyond which linearized theory definitely fails. This shows that a dynamic sample paths viewpoint (ǫ &gt; 0) and a singular limit (or quasi-static, ǫ = 0) approach to critical transitions can nicely complement each other.</p><p>From Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref> we can also conclude that the variance curves for the transcritical/pitchfork transition are substantially different from the fold transition. Since the two cases also have different recovery exponents for slowing down (see Proposition 2.10) it should be possible to distinguish between them using early warning signs.</p></div>

Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref> shows the variance of the x-variable, for each value of y, calculated from 1000 sample paths. More precisely, if we index the sample paths by j = 1, 2, . . . , 1000 we compute the variance of the fast variable {x j t } j for a fixed time t; since y = ǫt, we expect to re-compute an approximation to the variance for the stationary distributions p y s (x) if ǫ is sufficiently small, as long as we are not too close to y = 0 where noise-induced transi-tions and reflecting boundary effects are dominant. We have fixed the parameter values to (σ, ǫ) = (0.1, 0.02) which means for the fold bifurcation we rarely expect noise-induced transitions. Due to the different scaling laws for the transcritical and pitchfork bifurcations, we do expect noise-induced transitions in this case; cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>.

This is expected as sample paths are counted as escaped path for the numerical simulation once they reach the boundaries defined in (43) ("absorbing boundaries", ǫ &gt; 0) whereas the Fokker-Planck calculation in Section 7 assumed reflecting boundary conditions and ǫ = 0. This shows that due to the reflecting boundaries the variance is decreased near the transition point. The interesting conclusion from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">11</ref> is that different modeling techniques can produce different estimates for the moments in critical transition normal forms near the transition point. As long as we are far enough away in our approach the theories match up. This suggests to focus on this initial regime away from the bifurcation; this analysis is carried out in detail for all bifurcations up to codimension two in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>.</p><p>However, a major problem arises in a practical context, if we only have a single sample path to predict a critical transition, say γ t = (x t , y t ) for t ∈ [0, T ]. Usually one computes an earlywarning sign by considering a finite time interval (or window) of length s &lt; T and computes the sample path variance for this time interval <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>.

Then The deterministic critical manifold C is shown in grey and two subsets are marked (dashed red) which correspond to windows of length y ≈ 0.2861.

A window of size s ≈ 14.3051 is used which corresponds an interval of length ≈ 0.2861 for y as y = ǫt = 0.02t. For the transcritical and pitchfork bifurcations in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">11(b)-(c</ref>) we obtain shifted versions of the stationary variances i.e. the variance increases but local maxima are moved towards the critical transition. This is expected since the sample variance "lags behind" the stationary estimator that is computed at a fixed y for 0 ≤ ǫ ≪ 1.</p><p>The sample variance indicator for the fold transition in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">11</ref>(a) shows a clear monotone increasing deterministic trend and does not seem to lag behind the stationary variance calculation/simulation. This can be explained easily from the fast-slow geometry of the SDE as follows. Consider a single sample path near the fold transition shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref> at parameter values (σ, ǫ) = (0.1, 0.02). In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref>  windows we compute two sample variances</p><formula xml:id="formula_98">V (t * 1,2 ) = V 1,2</formula><p>where ǫt 1 ≈ -0.7 and ǫt * 2 ≈ -0.02 according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>. The mean values µ(t * 1,2 ) = µ 1,2 are marked with red dots. The variance is indicated by a red vertical lines [µ j -V j , µ j + V j ] for j = 1, 2 that have been centered at the mean values and stretched by a factor of 20 to make the variances easier to visualize. It is now obvious why the variance must increase "deterministically" near fold critical transition if measured using <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>; the critical manifold is locally parabolic and has much higher curvature near y = 0. Since the window size for the measurement has to be rather large to measure anything meaningful, the sample mean µ 2 is located further away from the critical manifold. Hence the sample variance will be larger due to geometric considerations and without even considering the noise effect. A good way to think about the situation is to project the subsets of the sample path corresponding to the two measurement windows onto the vertical red lines in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">12</ref>. The same argument does not hold for the transcritical and pitchfork bifurcations as the stable critical manifold before the transition is given by x = 0. This shows that practical measurement techniques have to be applied and interpreted very carefully if only a single sample path is available.</p></div>

There is a visible increasing trend in the autocorrelation for all three critical transition point.

These lines are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">14</ref>(b) and one increases (green) while the other decreases (black). We know that on average we expect an increasing autocorrelation but we would make an incorrect prediction from the black sample path. This demonstrates a need for a detailed analysis of the dependence of different indicators on the parameters. For example, for the autocorrelation we have the system parameters (ǫ, σ) and the measurement parameters (k, n) for the lag-k autocorrelation of a time series of length n.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10">Discussion</head><p>In this paper we have given an overview of the mathematical tools that can be applied to critical transitions. Our main viewpoint is that studying normal-form fast-slow stochastic dynamical systems should provide an additional route to understand critical transitions beyond studying models arising directly from applications. Standard methods from fast-slow systems have been used to formalize the definition of a critical transition. As the next step, different viewpoints from stochastic dynamics were reviewed and their contributions to the prediction of critical transitions was discussed. For example, we have pointed out that variance increase immediately follows from well-known results of sample paths analysis or that P-bifurcations could act as a novel prediction mechanism. Then we focused on the variance as an indicator in the setup of normal forms and used analytical, numerical and geometric ideas to understand the increasing variance near a critical transition. Throughout our analysis we highlighted several challenges that arise in the modeling process including noise types (additive/multiplicative), problems with single sample paths as well as scaling laws for noise-induced phenomena.</p><p>We have not discussed further mechanisms and early warning signs that have been reported in applications:</p><p>(a) The change in spatial structure of a dynamical system can often be used as an indicator for an upcoming transition <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71]</ref>. One could hope that bifurcation theory for pattern formation is applicable in this case <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>; in particular, reaction-diffusion PDEs might be the best starting point. The stochastic theory for SPDEs is much less developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> but statistical indicators are still expected to exist.</p><p>(b) We have focused primarily on the one-dimensional critical transitions (fold, transcritical, pitchfork). Although the pitchfork transition immediately gives results for the Hopf transition if the noise is only in the radial component, it does not capture its complete dynamics. The analysis of stochastic Hopf bifurcation is much more complicated than one-dimensional stochastic bifurcations <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. We expect that the general analysis can be particularly complicated by noise correlated between the two fast variables.</p><p>(c) Global bifurcations can induce drastic shifts in dynamical systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">89]</ref>. In this respect, it becomes evident that we should also address critical transitions for iterated maps since they appear as Poincaré maps for differential equations; for example, it is well-known that critical slowing down occurs near a period-doubling bifurcation <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p><p>(d) Chaotic systems might provide special indicators that could be examined <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>. The generation of many chaotic attractors is preceded by well-analyzed bifurcation sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. Therefore it is conceivable that one might be able to modify or extend existing methods to yield early warning signs.</p><p>(e) Fast-slow systems with three or more dimensions have not been discussed here. One example are fold bifurcations with two slow variables and one fast variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81]</ref> which occur generically on one-dimensional curves. Small oscillations can occur before a trajectory reaches a fold bifurcation and jumps to a far-away attractor. This behavior could be used as an indicator to predict a critical transition; a detailed review of the deterministic case in the context of mixed-mode oscillation can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Stochastic folded nodes are discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>(f) We have also not discussed the effect of noise on delay. The main point in this context is that small noise can reduce the deterministic delay effect discussed in Section 3; we refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> and references therein for a more detailed discussion. However, let us note that it be very desirable to find early-warning signs before the delay-region i.e. calculating the precise jump time should be the second step of the mathematical analysis.</p><p>We hope that the framework we reviewed and augmented in this paper also provides a better bridge between critical transitions in applications and the associated open mathematical challenges. It is expected that some new mathematical methods are going to be needed to address (a)-(f). Furthermore, we are fully aware that we have not maximized the results one can obtain from techniques presented here. For further results on normal forms, scaling of the variance and several applications see <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Two time series with critical transitions.
