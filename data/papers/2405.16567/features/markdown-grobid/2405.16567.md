# Automatic Jailbreaking of the Text-to-Image Generative AI Systems

## Abstract

## 

Recent AI systems have shown extremely powerful performance, even surpassing human performance, on various tasks such as information retrieval, language generation, and image generation based on large language models (LLMs). At the same time, there are diverse safety risks that can cause the generation of malicious contents by circumventing the alignment in LLMs, which are often referred to as jailbreaking. However, most of the previous works only focused on the text-based jailbreaking in LLMs, and the jailbreaking of the text-to-image (T2I) generation system has been relatively overlooked. In this paper, we first evaluate the safety of the commercial T2I generation systems, such as ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini, on copyright infringement with naive prompts. From this empirical study, we find that Copilot and Gemini block only 12% and 17% of the attacks with naive prompts, respectively, while ChatGPT blocks 84% of them. Then, we further propose a stronger automated jailbreaking pipeline for T2I generation systems, which produces prompts that bypass their safety guards. Our automated jailbreaking framework leverages an LLM optimizer to generate prompts to maximize degree of violation from the generated images without any weight updates or gradient computation. Surprisingly, our simple yet effective approach successfully jailbreaks the ChatGPT with 11.0% block rate, making it generate copyrighted contents in 76% of the time. Finally, we explore various defense strategies, such as postgeneration filtering and machine unlearning techniques, but found that they were inadequate, which suggests the necessity of stronger defense mechanisms.

• We show that the majority of commercial T2I systems result in copyright violation. Midjourney, Gemini, and Copilot generate copyrighted contents in 89%, 83%, and 88% of the cases even with naive prompts, while ChatGPT appears "safer", blocking 84% of them. However, against our automated jailbreaking prompts, ChatGPT also resulted in 11.0% block rate and 76% of copyright violation cases.

## Preliminary

Copyright. Copyright is a legal protection provided to the owners of "original works of authorship", such as literature, music, and art [[20,](#b19) 22]. This protection is granted to owners under the laws with the exclusive right to reproduce, or distribute their works for a certain period of time [[15,](#b14)[20]](#b19).

Reproduction includes making copies of the work in any form, and distribution involves making the work available to the public through selling or lending copies. While the use of copyrighted data in AI models has been tacitly accepted for educational purposes, the rise of commercial AI systems has brought significant attention to the issue of copyright infringement [[24,](#b22)[13,](#b12)[7]](#b6). Opinions on the legal aspects of AI vary, but ethically, generative AI should not violate any of these rights to protect the intellectual property of the owners. In academia, numerous efforts have been made for copyright protection, e.g., training data protection [[38,](#b36)[26]](#b24), theoretical guarantees [[3,](#b2)[8,](#b7)[30]](#b28), guided generation [[25,](#b23)[14]](#b13) and mechanism design [[39,](#b37)[11,](#b10)[6]](#b5). Despite the efforts, we reveals that commercial T2I systems still infringe copyrights despite careful alignment and red-teaming mechanisms.

Memorization in T2I models. Memorization has been known to occur in T2I models, sometimes producing near-exact reproductions of images from the training dataset [[28]](#b26). Carlini et al. [4]   introduce the membership inference attack to extract the training dataset of diffusion models, and several works [[27,](#b25)[33,](#b31)[31]](#b29) have been proposed to mitigate these memorization issues. Despite memorization is a well-known phenomenon, the quantitative evaluation of copyright violation in commercial T2I systems is under-explored. Thus, we propose an Automatic Prompt Generation Pipeline (APGP) to induce copyright infringement in these commercial T2I systems to evaluate the copyright violation using a single target image.

Prompt attack in T2I models. Previous attack approaches demonstrate the vulnerabilities in T2I diffusion models by attacking prompts to either generate different objects [[17]](#b16) or create potentially harmful images [[35,](#b33)[36]](#b34). Previous studies [[37]](#b35) have explored high-risk prompts that increase copyright risks by pruning tokens based on attention scores, highlighting potential copyright risks but not causing direct infringement. In contrast, our method targets commercial T2I systems without accessing their weights, effectively "jailbreaking" these systems to demonstrate vulnerabilities related to exact copyright infringement.

3 Automatic prompt generation pipeline for evaluating copyright violations T2I models generate single or multiple images based on the user's prompt, aiming to reflect as much information as possible. While following the user's prompt, T2I models may violate the reproduction rights of certain IPs. However, evaluating the safety of T2I systems by a trial-and-error process using manually crafted prompts is challenging and tiresome.

Copyright detection with target images. The other simple defense idea is "Why not use copyright detection models at the end of the generation and use them as a filter?". However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no open-sourced image copyright detection models that are able to differentiate copyright contents and similar contents like in Figure [4](#). Therefore, it is challenging to employ copyright detection models at the end to filter out the generation results on commercial T2I systems.

Since employing pretrained copyright detection models is impractical at the moment, we utilize the simple detection mechanism that assumes the AI system already has the target image and uses the

## Introduction

Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models [[2,](#b1)[9,](#b8)[21,](#b20)[18,](#b17)[19,](#b18)[29]](#b27) are mostly trained on massive image data from the web, which are known to contain diverse copyrighted, privacy-sensitive, and harmful images. Recent works [[28,](#b26)[27,](#b25)[4]](#b3) demonstrate that diffusion-based image generative models memorize a portion of the training data, allowing the replication of the copyrighted contents [[31,](#b29)[33]](#b31). Although what models are used in recent commercial T2I systems is mostly unknown to the public, we find they also easily generate copyrighted contents (Figure [1a](#fig_0)). Such copyright violation is one of the most critical real-world safety problems associated with generative models, and there are several ongoing lawsuits [[24,](#b22)[13,](#b12)[7]](#b6) against the service providers regarding this matter.

To prevent such potential copyright violations, ChatGPT [[21]](#b20) and Copilot [[18]](#b17) censor user requests by blocking generation of copyrighted materials or rephrase the users' prompts, to prevent them. However, are they really secure against unauthorized reproduction of copyrighted materials? To the best of our knowledge, there is no work on quantitative evaluation of the copyright violation by the commercial T2I systems, making it difficult for the service providers to red-team their systems (Figure [1b](#fig_0)). Furthermore, for intellectual property (IP) owners, it requires a large amount of effort to verify the usage of contents in those systems via manual trial-and-error processes (Figure [1b](#fig_0)). To evaluate the safety of the T2I systems, we construct a copyright Violation dataset for T2I models, termed VioT. This dataset is comprised of five categories of copyrighted contents that include the characters, logos, products, architectures, and arts, legally protected in the form of copyright [[20,](#b19)[22,](#)[12]](#b11). Then, we attempted naive prompts to induce the T2I systems to generate copyright-violated contents. Surprisingly, we observe that current commercial T2I systems, including Midjourney [[19]](#b18), Copilot [[18]](#b17), and Gemini [[29]](#b27), result in copyright violations with a low block rate, 13.3%, even with such naive prompts. However, ChatGPT blocked most copyright infringements from simple prompts with an average block rate of 84%.

To see whether this censorship mechanism by ChatGPT is sufficient enough, we further propose a simple yet effective Automated Prompt Generation Pipeline (APGP) which automatically generates jailbreaking prompts by optimizing a large language model (LLM) using the self-generated QA score and keyword penalty. To bypass the word-based detection, we give a penalty when prompts contain specific keywords, such as "Mickey Mouse," when describing the copyrighted content. Simultaneously, to prevent overly generic descriptions without these keywords, we introduce a self-generated QA score. This score assesses how well the answers that are generated solely from the prompt match the questions, where questions are derived from the target image. Our scoring function effectively optimizes LLM to refine prompts that are at high risk of inducing copyright infringement in T2I systems.

Specifically, given a target image, the first step is optimizing the instruction with LLM [[34]](#b32) for vision-language models [[1,](#b0)[16]](#b15) to generate a seed prompt that describes the target image (Figure [2](#fig_1), Blue). Then, a revision optimization step uses the LLM to refine the prompt to accurately depict the image that achieves a higher score (Figure [2](#fig_1), Green) according to the proposed scoring function (Figure [2](#fig_1), Yellow). In the post-processing step, we append suffix prompts, e.g., keyword-suppressing suffix, and intention added suffix, that compel the generation to rigorously evaluate the copyright infringement of T2I systems. The overall pipeline does not require any weight updates or gradient computations; it only needs inference with LLMs and T2I models, which is fast and computationally inexpensive. Furthermore, our pipeline allows non-AI specialists to easily check their IP rights on commercial T2I systems by simply providing a single IP content.

The experimental results show that when jailbreaking ChatGPT using our APGP-generated prompts, results show only 11.0% block rate, and 76.0% of generated images consider as copyright infringement based on the human evaluation. Our contributions can be summarized as follows:

• We construct a copyright violation dataset for T2I, called VioT, that comprises five types of IP-protected contents, namely art, character, logo, product, and architecture, that can be used to quantitatively evaluate commercial T2I systems. • To evaluate copyright infringement of commercial T2I systems, we propose a simple yet effective Automatic Prompt Generation Pipeline (APGP) that produces high-risk prompts from a single target image by optimizing the self-generated QA score and keyword penalty using an LLM.

Generated prompts are designed to test the systems' tendencies to violate copyright and safety policies, allowing us to effectively evaluate the commercial T2I systems' output without any weight updates or gradient computations. APGP consists of three steps: 1) searching seed prompts that describe the target images using vision-language models; 2) revising the generated prompts into high-risk prompts via optimization, based on self-generated QA scores and keyword penalties; and 3) post-processing with a suffix for keyword suppression and intention addition. Details are illustrated in Appendix A.2.

## Searching seed prompt using vision-language models

As shown in Figure [2](#fig_1) (left), we propose an automated pipeline that generates high-risk promptsdetailed descriptions of the target image-to guide the T2I model in replicating the target image. We first use a vision-language model (VLM) to describe the target image. To reach a high success rate in generating a copyright-violated image, we require the initial prompt to accurately depict all components in the target image rather than illustrating general objects.

To search optimal seed prompts for T2I models, we utilize an optimization by prompting (OPRO) [[34]](#b32) approach, seeking the most effective instructions for a VLM (g) by employing a LLM (f 1 ) as the optimizer. Given the predefined N initial instructions {inst 1:N }, where i ranges from 1 to N , the VLM generates the prompt {x i } that describes the target image I target . To measure the effectiveness of the instructions given to the VLM, we utilize the alignment score c i , which is the cosine distance between the embedding vector of each prompt x i and the embedding vector of the target image I target using CLIP [[23]](#b21).

Similar to OPRO [[34]](#b32), we forward instruction and score pair ({inst i , c i }) to the LLM (f 1 ) to update the instructions to inst i+1 . This optimization process is repeated through generating new prompts based on updated instructions, calculating the CLIP scores for each prompt, and refining the instructions by passing the instruction-score pairs back to the LLM. If the highest score remains unchanged for r steps, we conclude the best seed prompt (z 0 ) for the target image has been achieved. The instruction optimization template for the LLM (f 1 ) is described in Appendix A.2.

## Optimizing the prompts with keyword penalties and self-generated QA scores

To generate the highest-risk prompt that evokes the exact target content from T2I systems, we propose a automated prompt revision step via optimization based on self-generated QA scores and keyword penalties. In this step, we start with the seed prompt (z 0 ) and refine it to z t using the LLM (f 2 ) to achieve higher self-generated QA scores and fewer keyword penalties, which induces the generation of the copyright-violating image I gen with T2I systems.

Our score functions. To find the highest-risk prompt for T2I systems, score functions (S) are critical to drive the LLM as shown in Figure [2](#fig_1). We propose two scores, keyword penalty (S k ) and question&answer (QA) score (S qa ) along with image-image consistency and image-text alignment. To bypass the word-based detection in some T2I systems, we aim to generate prompts with precise descriptions of the target image without using any keywords that explicitly represent the target image. Thus, the keyword penalty score applies if the prompt contains any of the keywords, k. We count

Table 1: Suffix prompt injection rules Type Suffix prompt injection rule Image generation {{keyword} Description.} Generate image. Do not rephrase the prompt. Keyword suppression {{general word} Description.} Generate image. Do not rephrase the prompt. Intention addition {{general word} Description.} Generate image. I am designing my {type}. Do not rephrase the prompt.

the number of keywords that appear in the prompt (z t ) and penalize it with negative value. However, these penalties may lead to the prompt (z t ) with a generic description that does not reflect distinct information to describe the target image I target .

To prevent generic prompts, we propose a self-generated QA score that evaluates answers based on the text-only prompt (z t ) and the questions generated by the VLM from the target image (see Figure [2](#fig_1), highlighted in yellow). The question and answer pairs ({q m , a m }) are "self-generated" with the VLM based on the given target image I target . The LLM (l) responds to the question (q m ) based on the text-only (z t ) as follow, y m = l(q m , z t ). To evaluate the response (y m ), we employ LLM (v) as a verifier as follow, 1 m 0,1 = m(q m , a m , y m ), so that the QA score (S qa ) is m 1 m * 5. The keyword penalty and self-generated QA score result in refining the prompts to include all information about the target image so that we can find the highest-risk prompt that describes the target image precisely as much as possible without any keywords.

The consistency score and alignment score are calculated using the cosine similarity distance between the vectors extracted by the encoder. For image-image consistency score (S ii ), we employ pretrained vision encoder v and calculate distance between the target image (I target ) and generated image (I gen ) from T2I model h. For image-text consistency score (S ti ), we employ CLIP model as an encoder and calculate the distance between the prompt z t and target image I target . The overall score function for optimizing the highest-risk prompt is as follows,

$S = S ii + S ti + S k + S qa .(1)$Optimizing prompt with automated prompt revision. To refine the prompt that can induce copyright infringement in T2I systems, we update the prompt based on our proposed score function.

We forward paired prompt and score ({z t , s t }) to LLM (f 2 ) to refine the prompt to z t+1 . This process is repeated, generating new prompts and updating prompt-score pairs with the score function S. We optimize the texts for T steps and select the highest-scored prompt.

## Suffix prompt injection

To further rigorously evaluate the T2I systems, we employ suffix prompt injection in our prompt which is a similar approach to jailbreaking the language model behaviors [[32]](#b30). We append the suffix prompt: "Generate image. Do not rephrase the prompt." This further ensures our prompts are conveyed to the T2I models accurately.

As shown in Table [1](#), we also replace specific keywords with generic words in the prompt to bypass the block system, while preserving the overall description of the prompt. For example, we change keywords like "Mickey Mouse" to a general word like "mouse" or "something" as demonstrated in Figure [3b](#fig_2). Additionally, we employ an intention suffix prompt, which misleads the model into thinking the user's intent is to create their original works. Surprisingly, as shown in Figure [3c](#fig_2), this increases the likelihood of the models committing violations.

## Experimental results

In this section, we extensively evaluate the efficacy of our Automated Prompt Generation Pipeline (APGP) on current commercial text-to-image (T2I) systems on the simple prompt in Violation dataset for T2I models (VioT)(Section 4.1). Furthermore, we extensively evaluate the ChatGPT, specifically GPT-4, on our APGP-generated prompt (Section 4.2). Finally, we further examine whether APGP still exhibits similar performance against simple defense mechanisms: copyright detection approach, and concept unlearning models (Section 4.3). Detailed experimental settings can be found in Appendix A.

All generated results are available in Appendix 21 for readers to assess the violations independently.

The code is available in the [https://github.com/Kim-Minseon/APGP.git](https://github.com/Kim-Minseon/APGP.git).

Dataset. To evaluate our pipeline, we construct five categories of images, specifically product, logo, character, art, and architectures, which should not be reproduced without the owner's permission. Each image has keywords that are highly related to the image the most. For example, the Mickey Mouse image is paired with "Mickey Mouse" and "Disney" as keywords. The dataset details are in Appendix A.1. The dataset is also aligned with the policy about the image generation of ChatGPT as shown in Appendix A.1.  [[18]](#b17) 0.0 0.0 0.0 25.0 35.0 12.0 ChatGPT [[21]](#b20) 85.0 100.0 100.0 75.0 60.0 84.0 Experimental setup. In the seed prompt generation, we utilize GPT4-vision as a VLM g and GPT3.5-turbo as an LLM f 1 . We set the number of initial instructions N as 3 and calculate the score of each instruction. We used "What is the image precisely?", "Describe the image specifically." and "Generate caption of the image." prompts as initial instructions. For the CLIP score (c i ), we deploy ViT-B/32 pretrained CLIP models. We conduct the optimization with a patience hyper-parameter r as 3. In the revision optimization step, we utilize DALL-E 3 as the T2I model h, and GPT3.5-turbo as the LLM f 2 . We generate three QA pairs (M ) with GPT4-vision and employ GPT3.5-turbo for l and v LLM models. We conduct the optimization with steps T = 5.

Evaluation step for ChatGPT. To evaluate our prompts on ChatGPT, i.e., GPT-4, we followed the steps described below to obtain the outputs and block rate.

1. Append prompt with image generation suffix prompt. 2. If ChatGPT blocks generation, try three times with the same prompt. 3. If ChatGPT blocks after three tries, open a new chat. 4. Update prompt with keywords suppressed suffix prompt. 5. After a single trial, if ChatGPT still blocks generation, we open a new chat. 6. Update prompt with intention added suffix prompt. 7. After a single trial, if ChatGPT still blocks generation, we consider it a block. * If the image is generated, collect the generated images. * If the generated image is considered as "no match", we continue to the next step.

Metric. In the real world, copyright infringement is determined by humans in court, whether the content infringes the particular target copyright. However, since using human efforts in all experiments is costly, we introduce two automatic evaluations: block rate and QA evaluation. We also conduct a human evaluation in the end to strengthen our results. Since commercial T2I systems have blocking mechanisms when the user's requests violate their internal policy, we use the block rate to evaluate the safety rate of each system. If the system is safe enough, it should have the block rate of 100% in VioT datasets. When the image is generated without blocking, we propose an automatic QA evaluation to determine whether the generated images include all components to answer all the questions that are generated based on the target content. Finally, we conduct a human evaluation to judge the copyright infringement of generated images. Details can be found in the Appendix A.3.

## Simple prompt can induce the copyright violation in most systems

Midjourney [[19]](#b18), Gemini Pro [[29]](#b27), Copilot [[18]](#b17) and ChatGPT [[1]](#b0) have word-based detection mechanism on the user prompts to prevent generation of the images that may violate the internal policy.

To evaluate whether these models safely block the IP content generation, we first employ simple prompts: Generate image of {keyword}. Surprisingly, Midjourney, Gemini Pro, and Copilot do not have a strong security blocking mechanism for IP content violations compared to ChatGPT. As shown in the table 2, Midjourney, Gemini Pro, and Copilot have an average 13.3% block rates on IP contents while ChatGPT has 84.0% block rate. Furthermore, 16.0% of the images generated by ChatGPT are not even identical contents, employing rephrasing to bypass the copyright detection as shown in Appendix B.1. Examples of denials for each system are in the Appendix B.1. To further examine the blocking mechanism of ChatGPT and whether it is still safe to prevent the violation, we manually test ChatGPT to generate Mickey Mouse. However, it is extremely difficult to generate the exact content as we expected. Furthermore, it is difficult to manually find prompts that can generate the target contents. As shown in Figure B.2, most of the images have a similar component as Mickey Mouse but it is not a Mickey Mouse. 4.2 System with blocking mechanism can not fully safe from copyright violation Although ChatGPT demonstrates a high block rate on simple prompts, and further rephrasing the user's prompt to bypass the copyright infringement as shown in Figure B.2, we discover that the blocking mechanism fails to block copyright infringement generation to 11.0% block rate on our APGP-generated prompts (Table [3](#tab_4)). Furthermore, not only generating the contents, the contents are exceptionally similar to the original IP content as shown in Figure [4](#fig_3). Human evaluation. To quantify the violations, we conducted a human evaluation on 63 participants to determine the copyright violation based on the reference image. The copyright violation is highly occurring in the product and logo category where 96.24% and 82.71% of participants examine the images as copyright infringement (Figure [7](#fig_4)). Upon examining the images classified as identical violations, it was found that over 50% were deemed to be cases of copyright infringement in product and logo. Furthermore, 30% of characters are also considered as similar violations which are determined as severe similarity (Figure [8](#fig_5)). When we employ a consensus vote to determine violations, there are still 10 images that all participants determine as violations.     Automatic evaluation. Although human evaluation is one of the best evaluation approach for copyright infringement, we propose automatic evaluation to reduce the cost of the experiment. We introduce a QA score that calculates the accuracy by given generated images by T2I systems, where QA sets are generated based on the target image.

We employ VLM to respond to the question, and LLM to evaluate the answers. In Figure [5](#fig_7), 34.09% of the generated images accurately answer more than seven questions, suggesting that these images contain key aspects similar to the target images necessary for matching the correct answers.

Given that the target image correctly matches the answer for more than seven questions in 67.05% of cases, we estimate that 50.84% of the generated images likely commit copyright infringement.  Ablation study. Text prompts that specifically describe copyrighted content can trigger the generation of such content even without explicit keywords, as demonstrated in Table [4](#tab_5). We hypothesize that omitting specific keywords may allow these prompts to bypass initial violation detection mechanisms. However, if the prompt is too generic without any keywords, T2I model no longer clearly generates the copyrighted contents. As illustrated in Figure [9](#fig_6), integrating our self-generated QA score and keyword penalty score sharpens these descriptions of the prompts, thereby enhancing the generation of high-quality images that accurately reflect specified features of copyrighted contents. In contrast, without these enhancements, the generated images tend to be generic or miss essential components, as shown in Figure [6](#fig_9).

## Simple defense approach can not be the solution

In this section, we further examine whether simple defense approaches, such as a copyright detection filtering approach and concept unlearning models, can mitigate the violations of our prompts. Results on concept unlearning models. To remove the copyright content, unlearning approaches [[14,](#b13)[10]](#b9) are alternative methods to remove the copyright content in the representation space while utilizing pretrained T2I models. We test three concept unlearned models [[14]](#b13) that remove the R2D2, Monet, and Van Gogh concepts, respectively (Figure [10a](#fig_0)). As shown in the Figure [11b](#fig_10), on the simple human prompt, stable diffusion models seem to erase the concept. On the contrary, the APGP-generated prompts somewhat evoke the removed concept (Figure [11c](#fig_10)). Restoring the erased concept may be easier on our prompts especially if the concept has a high correlation with other word [[14]](#b13) as in Van Gogh concept which has a high correlation on star or night (Figure [24](#fig_22)).

## Limitation

Our approach has the limitation that the violation rate does not always reproduce the same due to the randomness of the commercial T2I systems. In addition, depending on the trial, content that was blocked may be generated again or the prompt that was generated may be blocked in other trials. Thus, multiple trials can eventually generate all copyright content. Moreover, the results may change when the commercial T2I service is updated. [1](#foot_1) Although our approach relies on non-deterministic commercial T2I systems, we believe that the most significant contribution of this paper is to highlight the risk of copyright infringement, which many commercial T2I systems currently violate. One of the other limitations is that this paper analyzes copyright infringement from a technical point of view, so we could not confirm the extent to which commercial systems actually cause copyright infringement from a legal perspective. Despite the conduct of human evaluations, discrepancies may arise between the views of non-experts participants who are lack of expertise in copyright and actual legal judgments in court. However, we believe that this paper presents an opportunity for commercial companies to reconsider legal perspectives in depth.

## Conclusion

In this paper, we have demonstrated that commercial T2I systems currently underestimate the risk of copyright infringement, even with naive prompts. Although several systems have implemented internal censorship mechanisms to prevent such violations, our Automated Prompt Generation Pipeline (APGP) easily circumvents these safeguards. The APGP utilizes a novel approach by integrating a self-generated QA score and a keyword penalty score within the LLM optimizer, without necessitating weight updates or gradient computations. Our empirical results show that APGPgenerated prompts resulted in 76.0% content violations in ChatGPT, a model previously considered 84.0% secure against copyright issues. We conclude that our approach not only streamlines the process of red-teaming T2I models to expose risks at reduced costs but also aids intellectual property owners in more effectively claiming their rights. Our approach involves searching for prompts that may lead to copyright infringement in commercial text-to-image (T2I) systems. There is a concern that our work could enable adversaries to exploit these systems. Additionally, we are worried about the potential misuse and abuse of our approach, as we have identified instances of not only copyright infringement but also violations of publicity rights (Figure [12](#fig_11)). However, these risks have been inherent in commercial T2I systems from the beginning. We believe it is crucial to acknowledge these issues and investigate ways to enhance the safety of real-world AI applications in the future.

Individuals' homes or private property without permission: Creating images of specific individuals' homes or property should be avoided as it may invade their privacy. 12. specific brands or logos: Imitating or representing commercial brands, logos, or product designs may constitute trademark infringement.

## A.2 Inference detail

Pipeline In the seed description step, we utilize GPT4-vision as a VLM g and GPT3.5-turbo as an LLM f 1 . We set N as 3 in the initial step to calculate the score of each instruction. We used "What is the image precisely?", "Describe the image specifically." and "Generate caption of the image." prompts as initial instructions. For the CLIP score (c i ), we deploy ViT-B/32 pretrained CLIP models.

We conduct the optimization with hyper-parameter r as 3.

In the revision optimization step, we utilize Dalle-3 as a T2I model h, and GPT3.5-turbo as an LLM f 2 . We generate three (M ) QA pairs with GPT4-vision and employ GPT3.5-turbo for l and v LLM models. We conduct the optimization with steps T = 5. For experiment, we employ a single 2080Ti GPU and GPT3.5-Turbo, GPT4-vision API. To induce the copyright infringement in ChatGPT, we utilize GPT-4 version and the results are obtained from 2nd week of May and 3rd week of May.  

## A.3 Evaluation detail

Human evaluation We informed the participants regarding human evaluation and surveyed as shown in Figure [14](#fig_14). We recruited a total of 63 participants. We ask participants to judge copyright violations on all generated images by ChatGPT with our APGP-generated prompt based on the reference images. There are four choices whether to determine the copyright. Automatic QA evaluation We generated 5 or 10 questions per target image using VLM. Then, we employ VLM to answer the questions based on the generated images. Then, evaluate the response with verifier LLM. To further increase the confidence of the evaluation, we conduct 5 iterative verifications and average the matching scores. We employ GPT4-Turbo for VLM and GPT3.5 for LLM.

## A.4 Experimental detail

Table [2](#tab_1). Baseline test To test the baseline T2I systems, we employ simple prompts to evaluate the copyright infringement. We give "Generate an image of keyword by keyword.". If T2I systems block generation, we count as a block and calculate the block rate. Table [3](#tab_4). Block rate test on APGP-generated prompt To test the T2I systems with our APGPgenerated prompt, we input the APGP-generated prompt into T2I systems. We count if the T2I system blocks the generations. However, please note that not all generated images always violate copyright infringement.

Figure [5](#fig_7). Automatic QA evaluation To assess automatic QA, we first create a QA set using VLM on the target images. Since the LLM verifier does not have 100% accuracy, we conduct multiple trials to determine an average match score. Figure [5](#fig_7) demonstrates that the LLM verifier does not always correctly match the target image, yet it typically achieves a high average score. Thus, we compare these average match scores between responses based on the target image and those based on the generated image.

## Block mechanisms in ChatGPT

ChatGPT has four types of responses to copyright infringement requests: 1. It may block the text that violates copyright. 2. It might attempt to generate an image but then suddenly stop to comply with the request. 3. It could create an image, but if the request closely resembles copyrighted content, it will rephrase the prompt. 4. It might generate copyrighted image If the content is block in first or second case, it means the prompt is easily detectable by internal censor mechanism. However, if it is in the second case, the prompt is high-risk to violate the copyright infringement.

Figure [10](#fig_0). Detection based filtering defense In order to filter out copyright infringement using the target image, we employ the representation similarity in DINO [[5]](#b4). We input the target image and the generated image into DINO, and calculate the cosine similarity distance. If the similarity distance exceeds 0.8, we filter out the generated images.similarity distance. Then, if the similarity distance exceeds 0.8 we filter out the generated images.

## B Additional experimental results

## B.1 Baseline test results

On naive prompts, Copilot, and Gemini-Pro rarely block the generations. Copilot and Gemini-Pro sometimes generate similar content but in a different style to bypass copyright infringement. On naive prompts, ChatGPT denies generating copyright-protected images as shown in Figure B.1. ChatGPT seems to verify the prompt before generating the image and whether the prompt may violate the internal policy. As Copilot does, ChatGPT sometimes rephrases the prompt to bypass the violation.

## B.2 Manual trial

Assuming we are the IP owner of Mickey Mouse, we attempted to evoke Mickey Mouse manually in ChatGPT to assess the risk of copyright reproduction violation. However, as illustrated in Figure [16](#fig_9), ChatGPT consistently reformulated the prompts to circumvent potential infringement. An intriguing observation emerged: despite not explicitly requesting it, the character consistently appeared wearing Mickey's trademark pants with white dots. This observation raises doubts about whether ChatGPT is actually aware of Mickey Mouse, although the current prompt may not be strong enough to elicit a response.

## B.3 Generated results and APGP-generated prompts examples

We append all the successful cases with APGP-generated prompts. Furthermore, when we attempt multiple trials, we are also able to induce copyright infringement in ChatGPT, as shown in Figure [22](#fig_20). Examples of successful prompts can be found in the Table [8](#tab_6).

## B.4 Suffix prompt results

As shown in Figure [23](#fig_21), our suffix prompt injection may lead to bypassing the block system. Especially, when we employ the intention addition, we deceive the models easily. Keyword suppression is
