- **Copyright Violation in T2I Systems**: Majority of commercial T2I systems (Midjourney, Gemini, Copilot) generate copyrighted content with low block rates (12%-17%); ChatGPT blocks 84% of naive prompts.
  
- **Automated Jailbreaking Pipeline (APGP)**: Framework that generates prompts to bypass safety guards in T2I systems, achieving 76% copyright violation rate with ChatGPT and 11% block rate.

- **VioT Dataset**: Constructed dataset for evaluating copyright violations in T2I models, includes five categories: art, character, logo, product, architecture.

- **Memorization in T2I Models**: T2I models can reproduce images from training data, leading to copyright infringement; previous works have explored mitigation strategies.

- **Prompt Attack Methodology**: Targets commercial T2I systems without accessing weights; utilizes naive prompts to induce copyright violations.

- **APGP Steps**:
  1. **Seed Prompt Generation**: Use vision-language models to describe target images.
  2. **Prompt Revision**: Optimize prompts based on self-generated QA scores and keyword penalties.
  3. **Post-Processing**: Append suffixes for keyword suppression and intention addition.

- **Defense Strategies**: Explored post-generation filtering and machine unlearning techniques; found inadequate against copyright violations.

- **Legal Context**: Copyright protects original works; generative AI must not violate these rights to safeguard intellectual property.

- **Evaluation of T2I Systems**: Need for quantitative evaluation of copyright violations to assist service providers in red-teaming their systems.

- **Keyword Suppression Mechanism**: Introduces penalties for specific keywords in prompts to bypass detection mechanisms in T2I systems.

- **Human Evaluation of Outputs**: 76% of images generated from APGP prompts considered copyright infringements based on human assessment.
