  "abstract": "Recent AI systems have shown extremely powerful performance, even surpassing\nhuman performance, on various tasks such as information retrieval, language\ngeneration, and image generation based on large language models (LLMs). At the\nsame time, there are diverse safety risks that can cause the generation of\nmalicious contents by circumventing the alignment in LLMs, which are often\nreferred to as jailbreaking. However, most of the previous works only focused\non the text-based jailbreaking in LLMs, and the jailbreaking of the\ntext-to-image (T2I) generation system has been relatively overlooked. In this\npaper, we first evaluate the safety of the commercial T2I generation systems,\nsuch as ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini, on copyright infringement with naive\nprompts. From this empirical study, we find that Copilot and Gemini block only\n12% and 17% of the attacks with naive prompts, respectively, while ChatGPT\nblocks 84% of them. Then, we further propose a stronger automated jailbreaking\npipeline for T2I generation systems, which produces prompts that bypass their\nsafety guards. Our automated jailbreaking framework leverages an LLM optimizer\nto generate prompts to maximize degree of violation from the generated images\nwithout any weight updates or gradient computation. Surprisingly, our simple\nyet effective approach successfully jailbreaks the ChatGPT with 11.0% block\nrate, making it generate copyrighted contents in 76% of the time. Finally, we\nexplore various defense strategies, such as post-generation filtering and\nmachine unlearning techniques, but found that they were inadequate, which\nsuggests the necessity of stronger defense mechanisms.",
