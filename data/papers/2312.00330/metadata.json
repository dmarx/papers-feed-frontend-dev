  "abstract": "Text-to-video (T2V) models have shown remarkable capabilities in generating\ndiverse videos. However, they struggle to produce user-desired stylized videos\ndue to (i) text's inherent clumsiness in expressing specific styles and (ii)\nthe generally degraded style fidelity. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce StyleCrafter, a generic method that enhances pre-trained T2V models\nwith a style control adapter, enabling video generation in any style by\nproviding a reference image. Considering the scarcity of stylized video\ndatasets, we propose to first train a style control adapter using style-rich\nimage datasets, then transfer the learned stylization ability to video\ngeneration through a tailor-made finetuning paradigm. To promote content-style\ndisentanglement, we remove style descriptions from the text prompt and extract\nstyle information solely from the reference image using a decoupling learning\nstrategy. Additionally, we design a scale-adaptive fusion module to balance the\ninfluences of text-based content features and image-based style features, which\nhelps generalization across various text and style combinations. StyleCrafter\nefficiently generates high-quality stylized videos that align with the content\nof the texts and resemble the style of the reference images. Experiments\ndemonstrate that our approach is more flexible and efficient than existing\ncompetitors.",
