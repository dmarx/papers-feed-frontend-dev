  "abstract": "While the impressive performance of modern neural networks is often\nattributed to their capacity to efficiently extract task-relevant features from\ndata, the mechanisms underlying this rich feature learning regime remain\nelusive, with much of our theoretical understanding stemming from the opposing\nlazy regime. In this work, we derive exact solutions to a minimal model that\ntransitions between lazy and rich learning, precisely elucidating how\nunbalanced layer-specific initialization variances and learning rates determine\nthe degree of feature learning. Our analysis reveals that they conspire to\ninfluence the learning regime through a set of conserved quantities that\nconstrain and modify the geometry of learning trajectories in parameter and\nfunction space. We extend our analysis to more complex linear models with\nmultiple neurons, outputs, and layers and to shallow nonlinear networks with\npiecewise linear activation functions. In linear networks, rapid feature\nlearning only occurs from balanced initializations, where all layers learn at\nsimilar speeds. While in nonlinear networks, unbalanced initializations that\npromote faster learning in earlier layers can accelerate rich learning. Through\na series of experiments, we provide evidence that this unbalanced rich regime\ndrives feature learning in deep finite-width networks, promotes\ninterpretability of early layers in CNNs, reduces the sample complexity of\nlearning hierarchical data, and decreases the time to grokking in modular\narithmetic. Our theory motivates further exploration of unbalanced\ninitializations to enhance efficient feature learning.",
