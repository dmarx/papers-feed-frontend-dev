- **Intrinsic Dimensionality Definition**: Measures the minimum number of parameters needed to achieve satisfactory solutions for an optimization problem. 

- **Key Finding**: Common pre-trained models exhibit low intrinsic dimensionality, allowing fine-tuning with significantly fewer parameters (e.g., 200 parameters for RoBERTa to achieve 90% of full performance on MRPC).

- **Reparameterization Method**: 
  - General form: \( \theta_D = \theta_{D0} + P(\theta_d) \)
  - Fastfood transform: \( \theta_D = \theta_{D0} + \theta_d M \) where \( M = HG\Pi HB \).

- **Satisfactory Solution Criterion**: Defined as achieving 90% of the performance metric of the full model, denoted as \( d_{90} \).

- **Structure-Aware Intrinsic Dimension (SAID)**: Incorporates layer-wise scaling to optimize specific layers, defined as:
  - \( \theta_D^i = \theta_{D0,i} + \lambda_i P(\theta_{d-m})_i \)

- **Empirical Results**: 
  - RoBERTa-Large can achieve 90% performance on MRPC with ~200 parameters and ~800 parameters for QQP.
  - Larger models tend to have lower intrinsic dimensions, enhancing their effectiveness.

- **Generalization Bounds**: Intrinsic dimensionality connects with low-dimensional task representations and compression-based generalization bounds, providing bounds independent of the full parameter count.

- **Pre-training Impact**: Pre-training minimizes intrinsic dimension, allowing models to generalize well across various tasks with fewer parameters.

- **Comparison of Methods**: SAID consistently outperforms the Direct Intrinsic Dimension (DID) method, highlighting the importance of structure in optimization.

- **Related Work**: Builds on previous work by Li et al. (2018) regarding intrinsic dimensionality and its implications for model capacity and fine-tuning effectiveness.

- **NLP Task Analysis**: Conducted on GLUE Benchmark tasks, demonstrating the low dimensionality of solutions across various pre-trained models (BERT, RoBERTa).

- **Computational Considerations**: The Fastfood transform allows efficient computation of intrinsic dimensionality, crucial for large models with hundreds of millions of parameters.
