## Detailed Technical Explanations and Justifications

### Entropy Definition
Entropy is a fundamental concept in information theory, introduced by Claude Shannon. It quantifies the uncertainty or randomness of a random variable. The definition of entropy as the minimum average number of bits required to represent an event following a probability distribution is crucial because it provides a theoretical lower bound on the amount of information needed to encode outcomes. This concept is foundational for various applications, including data compression, where the goal is to represent data in the most efficient manner possible.

### Key Information-Theoretic Measures
- **Mutual Information (MI)**: MI quantifies the amount of information that one random variable contains about another. It is defined as the reduction in uncertainty of one variable given knowledge of the other. This measure is essential in understanding the dependencies between variables, making it a powerful tool in feature selection and representation learning.

- **Conditional Mutual Information (CMI)**: CMI extends MI by measuring the information obtained about one random variable given another, while also conditioning on a third variable. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the relationship between two variables is influenced by a third variable, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of their interactions.

### Neural Joint Entropy Estimator (NJEE)
The NJEE is a novel approach that combines the chain rule of entropy with cross-entropy loss minimization to estimate joint entropy. The rationale behind this method is that traditional estimators often struggle with small sample sizes and large alphabet sizes. By leveraging the power of deep neural networks, NJEE can generalize better and provide more accurate estimates. The strong consistency of NJEE ensures that as the sample size increases, the estimates converge to the true entropy value, making it a reliable choice for practitioners.

### Conditional NJEE (C-NJEE)
C-NJEE builds upon NJEE by allowing for the estimation of joint conditional entropy. This extension is particularly valuable for estimating CMI and TE, as it provides a framework for understanding how information is shared between variables under certain conditions. The ability to accurately estimate conditional relationships is crucial in many fields, including neuroscience and finance, where understanding dependencies can lead to better decision-making.

### Cross-Entropy (CE)
Cross-entropy measures the average number of bits needed to represent an event from one distribution using another distribution. The minimization of CE is a powerful technique in machine learning, as it encourages the model to learn a distribution that closely approximates the true distribution of the data. The relationship between CE and entropy is fundamental, as minimizing CE effectively leads to better entropy estimates.

### Transfer Entropy (TE)
TE is a specific application of CMI that focuses on the flow of information between time series. By analyzing the past of one time series and its influence on the future of another, TE provides insights into causal relationships. This is particularly useful in fields like neuroscience, where understanding the flow of information can reveal underlying mechanisms of brain function.

### Performance Improvements
The NJEE and C-NJEE demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods, especially in scenarios with small sample sizes and large alphabet sizes. This is significant because many traditional methods, such as KNN-based estimators, suffer from negative bias and underestimation in high-dependency scenarios. The strong consistency of NJEE and C-NJEE ensures that they provide reliable estimates across various tasks, making them valuable tools for researchers and practitioners.

### Applications
The proposed estimators have broad applications in machine learning, including feature selection, representation learning, and analysis of learning mechanisms. In real-world scenarios, such as neuroscience and finance, accurate estimation of information-theoretic measures can lead to better insights and improved decision-making processes.

### Limitations of Existing Methods
Existing methods, such as classic plug-in estimators and KNN-based MI estimators, often suffer from biases and limitations in high-dimensional spaces. The NJEE and C-NJEE address these limitations by providing more robust and consistent estimators that can handle the complexities of real-world data.

### Mathematical Notation
The mathematical framework provided in the paper, including definitions of joint entropy, mutual information, and their relationships, is essential for understanding the theoretical underpinnings of the proposed estimators. The notation helps clarify the relationships between different information-theoretic measures and their estimators.

### Empirical Study
The empirical study demonstrates the effectiveness of NJEE and C-NJEE across various datasets and tasks, including protein datasets and financial time series. This validation is crucial for establishing the practical utility of the proposed methods and their superiority over existing approaches.

### Contributions
The introduction of NJEE and C-NJEE as strongly consistent estimators represents a significant advancement in the field of entropy estimation. The practical implementation scheme and the demonstrated performance improvements across various tasks highlight the potential of these methods to address longstanding challenges in information theory and its applications.
