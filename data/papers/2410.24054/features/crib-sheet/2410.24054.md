- **EigenVI Overview**: EigenVI is a score-based variational inference method that utilizes orthogonal function expansions to construct variational approximations, allowing for flexible modeling of complex distributions.

- **Variational Family Definition**: The K-th order variational family \( Q_K \) is defined as:
  \[
  q(z) = \left( \sum_{k=1}^{K} \alpha_k \phi_k(z) \right)^2 \quad \text{with} \quad \sum_{k=1}^{K} \alpha_k^2 = 1
  \]
  where \( \phi_k(z) \) are orthonormal basis functions.

- **Fisher Divergence**: The measure of closeness between the variational approximation \( q \) and the target distribution \( p \) is given by the Fisher divergence:
  \[
  D(q, p) = \left\| \nabla \log q(z) - \nabla \log p(z) \right\|^2_{q(z)} dz
  \]

- **Optimization Problem**: Minimizing the Fisher divergence reduces to solving a minimum eigenvalue problem, allowing EigenVI to avoid iterative gradient-based optimizations.

- **Score Matching**: EigenVI matches the score functions of the variational distribution and the target distribution, leveraging the ability to compute \( \nabla \log p(z) \) efficiently in many applications.

- **Unbiased Estimator**: An unbiased estimator for the Fisher divergence is constructed using importance sampling:
  \[
  D_\pi(q, p) = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^{B} \frac{q(z_b)}{\pi(z_b)} \left\| \nabla \log q(z_b) - \nabla \log p(z_b) \right\|^2
  \]

- **Quadratic Form Representation**: The unbiased estimator can be expressed as a quadratic form:
  \[
  D_\pi(q, p) = \alpha^\top M \alpha
  \]
  where \( M \) is a symmetric matrix capturing dependencies on the sample batch and the scores.

- **Basis Functions**: Common orthogonal basis functions include:
  - **Legendre Polynomials** for \( z \in [-1, 1] \)
  - **Fourier Series** for \( z \in S^1 \)
  - **Laguerre Polynomials** for \( z \in [0, \infty) \)
  - **Hermite Polynomials** for \( z \in \mathbb{R} \)

- **Sampling Procedure**: To generate samples from the variational distribution, the procedure involves:
  \[
  z^{(t)}_1 \sim q(z_1), \quad z^{(t)}_2 \sim q(z_2 | z_1), \quad z^{(t)}_3 \sim q(z_3 | z_1, z_2)
  \]

- **Performance Evaluation**: EigenVI demonstrates superior accuracy in approximating posterior distributions compared to existing Gaussian BBVI methods, particularly in handling multimodal and asymmetric distributions.

- **Limitations and Future Work**: Discussion on the limitations of EigenVI and potential avenues for future research are provided in the concluding section of the paper.
