Hereâ€™s a detailed technical explanation and rationale for the decisions made in the development of EigenVI, focusing on the various aspects of the methodology:

### 1. Choice of Using Orthogonal Function Expansions for Variational Approximations
Orthogonal function expansions provide a systematic way to represent complex functions as linear combinations of simpler, orthogonal basis functions. This choice allows for:
- **Flexibility**: The expansions can approximate a wide range of target distributions, including multimodal and asymmetric ones, by adjusting the number of basis functions.
- **Tractability**: The orthogonality property simplifies the computation of moments and integrals, making it easier to derive properties of the approximating distributions.
- **Expressiveness**: By using higher-order terms in the expansion, the method can capture non-Gaussian features of the target distribution, which is crucial for accurate inference in complex models.

### 2. Decision to Minimize Fisher Divergence Instead of KL Divergence
Minimizing Fisher divergence rather than KL divergence offers several advantages:
- **Score Matching**: Fisher divergence focuses on matching the score functions (gradients of log densities) of the variational and target distributions, which can be more stable and informative than matching the densities directly.
- **Avoiding Normalization**: Fisher divergence does not require the normalization constant of the target distribution, which is often intractable to compute in Bayesian settings.
- **Robustness**: This approach can be less sensitive to the choice of variational family, particularly in high-dimensional spaces where KL divergence can lead to poor approximations.

### 3. Selection of Basis Functions (e.g., Hermite, Legendre, Laguerre)
The choice of basis functions is critical for the expressiveness and computational efficiency of the variational family:
- **Hermite Polynomials**: Suitable for approximating distributions on the real line, particularly Gaussian-like distributions.
- **Legendre Polynomials**: Useful for approximating distributions on bounded intervals, providing a natural way to handle uniform distributions.
- **Laguerre Polynomials**: Effective for nonnegative distributions, such as those arising in Poisson processes or exponential families.
The selection is based on the properties of the target distributions and the support of the variational approximations.

### 4. Approach to Handle Non-Gaussian Distributions
EigenVI addresses non-Gaussian distributions by:
- **Higher-Order Terms**: Including higher-order terms in the orthogonal expansions allows the model to capture skewness and kurtosis, enabling it to approximate complex shapes.
- **Flexible Variational Families**: The use of different orthogonal functions tailored to the characteristics of the target distribution enhances the model's ability to represent non-Gaussian features.

### 5. Method for Calculating Low-Order Moments of Approximations
Calculating low-order moments is essential for understanding the behavior of the variational approximations:
- **Analytical Integration**: The orthogonality of the basis functions allows for straightforward computation of moments through integrals that can often be evaluated analytically.
- **Recursion Relations**: Utilizing recursion relations among the basis functions simplifies the computation of moments, making it efficient even for higher-order moments.

### 6. Strategy for Sampling from Variational Distributions
Sampling from the variational distributions is achieved through:
- **Numerical Inversion of CDFs**: For one-dimensional cases, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) can be numerically inverted to generate samples.
- **Nested Sampling**: For higher dimensions, a nested sampling approach is employed, where samples are drawn sequentially from conditional distributions, maintaining tractability.

### 7. Decision to Avoid Gradient-Based Optimization Methods
Avoiding gradient-based methods is motivated by:
- **Stability**: Gradient-based methods can be sensitive to hyperparameters like learning rates, which can lead to instability in convergence.
- **Closed-Form Solutions**: The formulation of the optimization problem as a minimum eigenvalue problem allows for direct computation of the optimal parameters without iterative updates.

### 8. Choice of Optimization Technique (Minimum Eigenvalue Problem)
The decision to frame the optimization as a minimum eigenvalue problem is based on:
- **Efficiency**: Solving an eigenvalue problem can be computationally efficient and avoids the complexities associated with iterative optimization.
- **Direct Solution**: This approach provides a direct solution to the variational parameters, ensuring that the optimization is both fast and reliable.

### 9. Handling of Multimodal and Asymmetric Distributions
EigenVI effectively handles multimodal and asymmetric distributions through:
- **Expressive Variational Families**: The use of orthogonal function expansions allows for the representation of multiple modes and asymmetries by adjusting the number of basis functions.
- **Higher-Order Terms**: These terms can capture the nuances of complex distributions, ensuring that the variational approximation remains accurate.

### 10. Trade-off Management Between Expressiveness and Computational Cost
The design of EigenVI carefully balances expressiveness and computational efficiency by:
- **Controlled Complexity**: The
