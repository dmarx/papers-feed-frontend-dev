  "abstract": "We develop EigenVI, an eigenvalue-based approach for black-box variational\ninference (BBVI). EigenVI constructs its variational approximations from\northogonal function expansions. For distributions over $\\mathbb{R}^D$, the\nlowest order term in these expansions provides a Gaussian variational\napproximation, while higher-order terms provide a systematic way to model\nnon-Gaussianity. These approximations are flexible enough to model complex\ndistributions (multimodal, asymmetric), but they are simple enough that one can\ncalculate their low-order moments and draw samples from them. EigenVI can also\nmodel other types of random variables (e.g., nonnegative, bounded) by\nconstructing variational approximations from different families of orthogonal\nfunctions. Within these families, EigenVI computes the variational\napproximation that best matches the score function of the target distribution\nby minimizing a stochastic estimate of the Fisher divergence. Notably, this\noptimization reduces to solving a minimum eigenvalue problem, so that EigenVI\neffectively sidesteps the iterative gradient-based optimizations that are\nrequired for many other BBVI algorithms. (Gradient-based methods can be\nsensitive to learning rates, termination criteria, and other tunable\nhyperparameters.) We use EigenVI to approximate a variety of target\ndistributions, including a benchmark suite of Bayesian models from posteriordb.\nOn these distributions, we find that EigenVI is more accurate than existing\nmethods for Gaussian BBVI.",
