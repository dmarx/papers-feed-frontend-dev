- **gMLP Overview**: A simple MLP-based architecture that performs comparably to Transformers in language and vision tasks, challenging the necessity of self-attention.
  
- **Key Findings**:
  - gMLP achieves similar accuracy to Vision Transformers (ViT) on ImageNet with 66% fewer parameters.
  - For BERT, gMLP matches Transformers in pretraining perplexity and outperforms on some downstream NLP tasks.

- **Architecture**:
  - gMLP consists of L blocks with identical structure: 
    \[
    Z = \sigma(XU), \quad Z = s(Z), \quad Y = ZV
    \]
    where \( \sigma \) is an activation function (e.g., GeLU), and \( U, V \) are linear projections.

- **Spatial Gating Unit (SGU)**:
  - Enables cross-token interactions through:
    \[
    s(Z) = Z \cdot f_{W,b}(Z)
    \]
    where \( f_{W,b}(Z) = WZ + b \) and \( W \) is independent of input representations.
  - Initialization: \( W \) near-zero, \( b \) as ones to stabilize training.

- **Performance Metrics**:
  - gMLP achieves 87.7% accuracy on MNLI and 82.1% F1 on SQuAD v2.0, outperforming BERT large results.
  - Performance gap with Transformers can be closed by increasing gMLP size (3Ã— larger).

- **Image Classification**:
  - gMLP shows competitive performance against ViT and DeiT, with improved regularization techniques.
  - Regularization: Similar to DeiT, adjusting stochastic depth based on model size.

- **Masked Language Modeling**:
  - Follows BERT's input/output protocols without positional encodings or masking <pad> tokens.
  - gMLP learns Toeplitz-like matrices for spatial weights, indicating shift invariance.

- **Ablation Studies**:
  - Comparison with various BERT configurations to assess the importance of gating in gMLP.
  - Results indicate that self-attention is not essential for model performance, but can enhance efficiency in certain tasks.

- **Conclusion**:
  - gMLP demonstrates that simpler architectures can achieve competitive performance with Transformers, suggesting a reevaluation of self-attention's role in model design.
