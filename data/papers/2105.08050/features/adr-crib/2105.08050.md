The proposal of gMLP as an alternative to Transformers and the various design choices made by the researchers can be understood through a combination of theoretical insights, empirical observations, and practical considerations. Below is a detailed technical explanation for each of the decisions mentioned:

### 1. Decision to Propose gMLP as an Alternative to Transformers
The researchers aimed to explore whether self-attention is essential for the performance of models in language and vision tasks. By proposing gMLP, they sought to demonstrate that a simpler architecture based on MLPs with gating could achieve comparable performance to Transformers, thereby questioning the necessity of self-attention mechanisms. This exploration is significant as it opens avenues for more efficient architectures that may require less computational overhead.

### 2. Choice of Using MLPs with Gating Instead of Self-Attention
The decision to use MLPs with gating was motivated by the desire to simplify the model architecture while still capturing complex interactions between tokens. Gating mechanisms allow for dynamic modulation of information flow, which can effectively replace the role of self-attention in aggregating information across tokens. This choice also aligns with the hypothesis that static parameterization can still represent complex functions, challenging the notion that dynamic attention is indispensable.

### 3. Design of the Spatial Gating Unit (SGU)
The SGU was designed to facilitate cross-token interactions while maintaining the simplicity of MLPs. By splitting the input into two independent parts, the SGU can apply a gating mechanism that modulates the information flow based on spatial interactions. This design allows for efficient computation and captures spatial relationships without the overhead of self-attention, which is computationally expensive.

### 4. Decision to Follow BERT's Input and Output Protocols
By adhering to BERT's input and output protocols, the researchers aimed to ensure compatibility with existing Transformer implementations and avoid confounding factors in their experiments. This decision also allows for a fair comparison of gMLP with Transformers, as it maintains the same data processing and output generation methods.

### 5. Choice of Linear Projections for Channel and Spatial Projections
Linear projections were chosen for their simplicity and effectiveness in transforming data without introducing unnecessary complexity. This choice aligns with the goal of maintaining a lightweight architecture while still enabling the model to learn meaningful representations. Linear projections also facilitate easier optimization and training stability.

### 6. Decision to Initialize Weights for Training Stability
The researchers found that initializing weights close to zero for the spatial gating unit was critical for training stability. This initialization ensures that the model behaves like a standard feedforward network at the beginning of training, allowing it to learn effectively before gradually incorporating spatial interactions. This approach mitigates issues related to exploding or vanishing gradients.

### 7. Choice to Split Input into Two Independent Parts for Gating
Splitting the input into two independent parts allows the model to separately process the gating mechanism and the main input. This design enhances the model's ability to learn complex interactions while maintaining a clear pathway for information flow. It also enables the model to leverage different aspects of the input for more nuanced representations.

### 8. Decision to Apply gMLP to Both Image Classification and Masked Language Modeling
The application of gMLP to both image classification and masked language modeling was driven by the desire to evaluate the model's versatility across different domains. This decision allows for a comprehensive assessment of gMLP's performance and its potential as a general-purpose architecture.

### 9. Choice of Hyperparameters for Training gMLP Models
The choice of hyperparameters was likely influenced by empirical results from previous studies on Transformers and MLPs. The researchers aimed to optimize the training process while ensuring that the model could scale effectively with increased data and compute resources. This careful tuning is essential for achieving competitive performance.

### 10. Decision to Compare gMLP Performance with Existing Transformer Models
Comparing gMLP with existing Transformer models was crucial for validating the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. This decision allows the researchers to quantify the performance of gMLP relative to state-of-the-art models, providing insights into its strengths and weaknesses.

### 11. Choice to Use a Larger gMLP Model to Close Performance Gaps
The decision to scale up the gMLP model was based on empirical observations that larger models tend to perform better. By increasing the model size, the researchers aimed to demonstrate that gMLP could achieve parity with Transformers, reinforcing the idea that model capacity is a key factor in performance.

### 12. Decision to Blend in a Small Amount of Self-Attention for Improved Performance
Incorporating a small amount of self-attention was a strategic decision to enhance the model's performance on tasks that require cross-sentence alignment. This hybrid approach allows gMLP to leverage the strengths of both architectures, providing a practical solution to specific challenges while maintaining the simplicity of the original design.

### 13. Choice of Regularization Techniques to Prevent Overfitting
The researchers applied regularization techniques similar to those used in Transformers to mitigate overfitting, especially given the tendency of gMLP models
