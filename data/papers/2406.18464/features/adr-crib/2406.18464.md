The decisions made by the researchers in the context of the Bayesian inverse Navier-Stokes (N-S) problem are grounded in a combination of theoretical foundations, practical considerations, and the specific challenges posed by fluid dynamics. Below is a detailed technical explanation and rationale for each of the decisions listed:

### 1. Decision to use a Bayesian framework for inverse Navier-Stokes problems
The Bayesian framework is chosen because it provides a systematic way to incorporate prior knowledge and uncertainty into the modeling process. Inverse problems, such as reconstructing flow fields from data, are inherently ill-posed and can benefit from regularization. The Bayesian approach allows for the formulation of a posterior distribution that combines prior beliefs about the parameters with the likelihood of the observed data, enabling the estimation of parameters and flow fields in a probabilistic manner.

### 2. Choice of Gaussian prior distributions for regularization
Gaussian priors are selected due to their mathematical convenience and the ability to encode prior knowledge about the parameters in a straightforward manner. They facilitate the use of analytical techniques and lead to closed-form solutions in many cases. Additionally, Gaussian distributions are well-understood and can effectively model uncertainties in the parameters, making them suitable for regularization in inverse problems.

### 3. Selection of a variational setting for problem formulation
The variational setting is chosen because it allows for the formulation of the N-S equations in a weak form, which is essential for handling complex geometries and boundary conditions. This approach also enables the use of finite element methods, which are well-suited for numerical implementation. The variational framework provides a natural way to incorporate constraints and regularization terms, leading to a more robust solution.

### 4. Implementation of a stabilized Nitsche weak form for the Navier-Stokes problem
The stabilized Nitsche method is implemented to handle the challenges associated with enforcing boundary conditions in the presence of discontinuities or complex geometries. This method allows for weak enforcement of boundary conditions, which can improve stability and convergence in numerical simulations. It is particularly useful for high Reynolds number flows, where instabilities may arise.

### 5. Use of a viscous signed distance field (vSDF) for geometry regularization
The vSDF is employed to provide a smooth representation of the geometry, which is crucial for accurately modeling the flow field. By using a viscous signed distance function, the method can regularize the geometry and ensure that the boundaries are well-defined, even in the presence of noise or uncertainty in the data. This approach helps to improve the accuracy of the flow reconstruction.

### 6. Decision to employ an adjoint-consistent stabilized cut-cell finite element method
This choice is made to ensure that the numerical method is both stable and accurate, particularly for complex geometries. The adjoint-consistent formulation allows for efficient computation of gradients needed for optimization, which is essential in the context of Bayesian inversion. The cut-cell method enables the handling of arbitrary geometries while maintaining the accuracy of the finite element method.

### 7. Choice of flow-MRI data for validation of the method
Flow-MRI data is selected because it provides high-resolution, time-resolved measurements of velocity fields in complex geometries, such as blood vessels. This type of data is particularly relevant for validating the proposed method, as it reflects real-world applications in biomedical engineering. The availability of both low and high SNR data allows for a comprehensive assessment of the method's robustness.

### 8. Decision to extend methodology from 2D to 3D flows
Extending the methodology to 3D flows is essential for practical applications, particularly in biomedical contexts where blood flow occurs in three-dimensional geometries. The complexity of 3D flows presents additional challenges, but addressing these allows for more accurate modeling of real-world scenarios, enhancing the applicability of the research.

### 9. Definition of data-to-model projection operator for imaging problems
The data-to-model projection operator is defined to facilitate the mapping of model parameters to observable quantities. This operator is crucial for linking the model predictions to the experimental data, allowing for the assessment of how well the model fits the observed data. It plays a key role in the Bayesian framework by enabling the computation of the likelihood function.

### 10. Incorporation of viscous Eikonal equation as a constraint
The viscous Eikonal equation is incorporated to impose additional geometric constraints on the problem, ensuring that the inferred geometry is physically plausible. This constraint helps to regularize the problem and improve the stability of the numerical solution, particularly in regions where the flow may be complex or turbulent.

### 11. Choice of numerical implementation details for the discrete Bayesian inverse N-S problem
The numerical implementation details are chosen to ensure that the algorithm is efficient and robust. This includes selecting appropriate discretization techniques, convergence criteria, and optimization algorithms. The goal is to balance computational efficiency with accuracy, allowing for practical applications in real-time scenarios.

### 12. Decision to treat blood vessel geometry as an unknown in the inverse problem
By treating the blood vessel geometry as an unknown, the researchers can
