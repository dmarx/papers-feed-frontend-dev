<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We formulate and solve a Bayesian inverse Navier-Stokes (N-S) problem that assimilates velocimetry data in order to jointly reconstruct a 3D flow field and learn the unknown N-S parameters, including the boundary position. By hardwiring a generalised N-S problem, and regularising its unknown parameters using Gaussian prior distributions, we learn the most likely parameters in a collapsed search space. The most likely flow field reconstruction is then the N-S solution that corresponds to the learned parameters. We develop the method in the variational setting and use a stabilised Nitsche weak form of the N-S problem that permits the control of all N-S parameters. To regularise the inferred geometry, we use a viscous signed distance field (vSDF) as an auxiliary variable, which is given as the solution of a viscous Eikonal boundary value problem. We devise an algorithm that solves this inverse problem, and numerically implement it using an adjoint-consistent stabilised cut-cell finite element method. We then use this method to reconstruct magnetic resonance velocimetry (flow-MRI) data of a 3D steady laminar flow through a physical model of an aortic arch for two different Reynolds numbers and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels (low/high). We find that the method can accurately i) reconstruct the low SNR data by filtering out the noise/artefacts and recovering flow features that are obscured by noise, and ii) reproduce the high SNR data without overfitting. Although the framework that we develop applies to 3D steady laminar flows in complex geometries, it readily extends to time-dependent laminar and Reynoldsaveraged turbulent flows, as well as non-Newtonian (e.g. viscoelastic) fluids.</p></div>

Inverse N-S problems have been intensively studied during the last decade, mainly enabled by the increase of available computing power. Recent applications in fluid dynamics range from the forcing inference problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[Fou+14;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">HLS14]</ref>, to the reconstruction of scalar image velocimetry (SIV) <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[Gil+18;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Sha+19]</ref> and particle image velocimetry (PIV) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[GBY19]</ref> data, and the identification of optimal sensor arrangements <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[MCS17;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Ver+19]</ref>. Regularisation methods that can be used to reduce the search space of model parameters are reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[Stu10]</ref> from a Bayesian perspective, and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[BB18]</ref> from a variational perspective. The well-posedness of Bayesian inverse N-S problems has been addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[Cot+09]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Flow field reconstruction</head><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[KB18]</ref> the authors treat the reduced inverse N-S problem of finding the Dirichlet boundary condition for the inlet velocity that matches the modelled velocity field to flow-MRI data for a steady 3D flow in a glass replica of the human aorta. They measure the data-model discrepancy using the L 2 -norm and introduce additional variational regularisation terms for the Dirichlet boundary condition. The same formulation is extended to periodic flows in [Kol19; KCH19], using the harmonic balance method for the temporal discretisation of the N-S problem. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[Fun+19]</ref> the authors address the problem of inferring both the inlet velocity (Dirichlet) boundary condition and the initial condition, for unsteady blood flows and 4D flow-MRI data in a cerebral aneurysm. Note that the above studies consider rigid boundaries and require a priori an accurate, and time-averaged, geometric representation of the blood vessel, which is a severe constraint on the inverse problem of finding the velocity field.</p><p>To find the shape of the flow domain, e.g. the blood vessel boundaries, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is often used. The acquired image is then reconstructed, segmented, and smoothed. This process not only requires substantial effort and the design of an additional experiment (e.g. CT, MRA), but it also introduces geometric uncertainties <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[Mor+16;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">San+16]</ref>, which, in turn, affect the predictive confidence of arterial wall shear stress distributions and their mappings <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[Kat+07;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Sot+16]</ref>. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[Fun+19]</ref> the authors report discrepancies between the modelled and the measured velocity fields near the flow boundaries, and they suspect they are caused by geometric errors that were introduced during the boundary segmentation process. In general, the assumption of rigid boundaries either implies that a time-averaged geometry has to be used, or that an additional experiment (e.g. CT, MRA) has to be conducted to register the moving boundaries to the flow measurements. A more consistent approach to this problem is to treat the blood vessel geometry as an unknown when solving the generalised inverse N-S problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[Kon+22]</ref>. In this way, the method simultaneously reconstructs and segments the velocity fields and can better adapt to the velocimetry experiment by correcting the geometric errors and improving the reconstruction. In other words, the velocity field is used to find the boundary, and the boundary is used to find the velocity field. This is a neater optimisation problem since it removes the severe constraint of fixing the boundary before assimilating the velocity field.</p><p>In this study we build upon the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[Kon+22]</ref>. In particular, we i) extend the methodology from 2D to 3D flows, ii) define the data-to-model projection operator for imaging problems, iii) incorporate a stabilised Nitsche cut-cell finite element method for the N-S problem that remains robust for high Re numbers and leads to an adjoint-consistent discrete formulation (i.e. the discretised continuous adjoint operator is equivalent to the discrete adjoint operator), iv) revise and improve the implicit representation of the geometry by incorporating the viscous Eikonal equation as an additional constraint to the problem, and v) describe the numerical problem in detail by defining the discrete function spaces and the stabilised discrete weak forms that make up the inverse problem. We then devise an improved algorithm that solves this Bayesian inverse N-S problem, and demonstrate it on flow-MRI data of a 3D steady laminar flow through a physical model of an aortic arch for low and high Re numbers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.1">Deep learning reconstruction algorithms</head><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, such as deep neural networks (NNs), are versatile, relatively simpler to implement, and have revolutionised the field of computer vision. There are, however, fundamental problems that still need to be addressed for their application to physics-based problems such as flow field reconstruction (e.g. AI-generated hallucinations, and the problem of existence of stable computational algorithms) <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[Muc+21;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">CAH22]</ref>. Physics-informed NNs (PINNs) cannot yet solve boundary value problems, (e.g the N-S problem) more efficiently than finite element methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[Gro+24]</ref>. Further, PINNs contain orders of magnitude more degrees of freedom than the method in this paper, with a corresponding increase in the required amounts of data and training time. The method in this paper is, in contrast, formulated from a N-S boundary value problem in a variational framework. The physics is hardwired into the model, meaning that the search space is restricted to solutions that satisfy the N-S problem. This is a key-difference between PINNs and the approach in this study: while PINNs solve a minimisation problem<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> , we solve a saddle point problem. In other words, PINNs do not hardwire the N-S problem; they simply penalise its residuals (i.e. they treat the N-S problem as a soft constraint). In our experience, solving the saddle point problem, even though more computationally expensive, leads to superior flow field reconstructions and more accurate inferred parameters. Unlike NNs [Fer+20; RRAJ21] and PINNs [Sai+24; Zhu+24], our model is relatively small, physically interpretable, amenable to mathematical analysis, extrapolatable, and will reconstruct flows that it has not seen before, thus enabling digital twin applications in engineering design and patient-specific cardiovascular modelling.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Bayesian inversion of nonlinear models</head><p>Given experimental, possibly noisy and sparse, vector field data of a physical quantity, u ⋆ , we assume that we already know a physical model, u = u(x), that can fit the data for suitable, physicallyinterpretable parameters, x. In other words, there exist parameters x • such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">u ⋆ ≃ Zx • = SQ x • = Su • ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where '≃' denotes an approximation in some metric space to be defined later, Z := SQ is the operator that maps model parameters to model solutions projected into the data space, S is the model space to data space projection operator, which is linear and non-invertible<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref> , and Q is the operator that encapsulates the physical model, which is nonlinear. Under this assumption, the main goal is to find x • , which is of interest because it often pertains to physical quantities that cannot be directly measured, and which are instead inferred from the data. At the same time, we obtain the reconstructed (model-filtered) velocity field, u • ≡ Qx • , which fits (as opposed to overfits) the noisy, sparse, and under-resolved data, u ⋆ . Starting from the assumptions that i) the model explains the data, and ii) the data noise is Gaussian, we write</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">u ⋆ -Zx = ε ∼ N (0, C u ⋆ ) ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where ε ∼ N (0, C u ⋆ ) is Gaussian noise with zero mean and with covariance operator C u ⋆<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">foot_2</ref> . We also assume that we have prior knowledge of the probability distribution of the model parameters, x. We call this the prior parameter distribution, N (x, C x), which we assume to be Gaussian with prior mean x, and prior covariance operator C x. We then use Bayes' theorem, which states that the posterior probability density function (p.d.f.) of x, given the data u ⋆ , π x u ⋆ , is proportional to the data likelihood, π u ⋆ x , times the prior p.d.f. of x, π x , i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">π x u ⋆ ∝ π u ⋆ x π(x) = exp - 1 2 ∥u ⋆ -Zx∥ 2 C u ⋆ - 1 2 ∥x -x∥ 2 Cx (4)</formula><p>where π(•) is the Gaussian p.d.f., and</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">∥•, •∥ 2 C := •, C -1 • is the covariance-weighted L 2 -norm.</formula><p>The most likely parameters x • , in the sense that they maximise the posterior p.d.f.

Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates the conceptual difference between linear, weakly nonlinear, and strongly nonlinear operators Z. In this study, Z encodes a Navier-Stokes problem, and the 'strength' of the nonlinearity depends on the flow conditions (e.g. on the geometry and the boundary conditions) and the Reynolds number, Re. Note that, for Re ≪ 1, the N-S problem can be approximated well enough by the Stokes problem, which is linear. At the other end of the spectrum, for sufficiently large Re, the flow becomes turbulent, which is a strongly nonlinear phenomenon. It should be emphasised that what matters is the behaviour of Z around the MAP point, x • , and within the ∼ 3σ support of the joint density, π(x, u ⋆ ). If Z is to be linearised around x • , the greater the spread of π(x, u ⋆ ), the less accurate the approximation will be. Also, the spread of π(x, u ⋆ ) depends on i) the noise level in the data, and ii) the assumed prior distribution of the N-S unknowns, x. This implies that, when Z is strongly nonlinear, we may require higher-quality data and/or more informative priors in order to regularise the inverse problem. Alternatively, we can simplify or reformulate the model such that Z exhibits smoother behaviour. In turbulent flows, for example, the large scales will depend on the geometry and the boundary conditions of the problem, while the small scales of turbulence exhibit a universal behaviour that is not directly linked to these parameters. Hence, inferring the evolution of the averaged velocity and pressure fields using the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, instead of the instantaneous fields that are governed by the N-S equations, can lead to a well-posed inverse problem. In this paper, however, we only consider laminar flow with a Newtonian viscosity model.</p></div>

Starting from an initial guess of the velocity field, u 0 , we solve (67) with β → u 0 in order to obtain a new velocity field, u 1 . This leads to an iterative process that under certain conditions converges to a fixed point such that ∥u k+1 -u k ∥ → 0 when k → ∞. The initial guess, u 0 , can be obtained by solving the Stokes problem that corresponds to (31). Picard iteration is robust and easy to implement, but converges slowly. In contrast, Newton iteration convergences faster, but requires a good initial approximation of the velocity field. Consequently, to solve N-S we first perform a few Picard iterations in order to obtain a good initial approximation of the velocity field, and then switch to Newton iterations. The Newton iteration is defined through the following update rule</p><formula xml:id="formula_95">u k+1 → u k + τ u ′ , p k+1 → p k + τ p ′ ,</formula><p>where u ′ , p ′ are the velocity and pressure perturbations, and τ is a line search step size. The line search step is initially taken as τ = 1 but it can be reduced via a backtracking line search algorithm to facilitate convergence when the initial guess is far away from the solution. The velocity and pressure perturbations are obtained after solving the Newton problem</p><formula xml:id="formula_96">D M I u D M I p D M II u 0 k u ′ p ′ = -R u k -R p k ,<label>(68)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_97">R u k := A u k u k + Bp -J u , (69a) R p k := -B * u k -J p ,<label>(69b)</label></formula><p>are the momentum and mass conservation residuals of the N-S problem, respectively. The Newton problem for the perturbations y ′ can also be written in compact form as D M y y ′ = -R, where D M y is given by (41).</p><p>To simplify the formulation, and to remain consistent with the operator-based approach we have adopted in this study, we use the nonlinear operator Q, which maps N-S parameters, x, to N-S velocity and pressure fields, y, to denote the Picard/Newton iteration approach to solving the N-S problem. When we write</p><formula xml:id="formula_98">y = Q x ,<label>(70)</label></formula><p>we therefore imply that an iterative approach is used to solve the N-S problem for given parameters, x. Note that, in order to simplify the exposition in section 2, we defined Q as the operator that maps parameters, x, to velocity fields, u, instead of N-S solutions (u, p). This abuse of notation, however, does not introduce any problems or inconsistencies in the formulation because p is simply an (internal) Lagrange multiplier that enforces the divergence-free constraint of the N-S problem.</p></div>

This is because, if the algorithm is to be discretised and solved by a computer, the operator G * k , as defined by (65), is constructed using the inverse of (D M y ) * k , which is not necessarily sparse and thus prohibitively expensive (or impossible for large-scale problems) to store in computer memory, even with state-of-the-art hardware. The operator (D M y ) * k , however, is known to be sparse and can thus be stored in computer memory. Once the total gradient is computed, gradient information is used to update the posterior parameter covariance approximation, C x k+1 , using the BFGS quasi-Newton method. To accelerate the algorithm we do not impose the Wolfe conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[Fle00]</ref> (since they require additional evaluations of the N-S and the adjoint N-S problems). We, however, use damping <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[GRB20]</ref> to ensure C x k remains positive definite, and its approximation remains numerically stable. The initial step size of the backtracking line search, τ , is obtained by f (x ′ , y ′ ), which is a problem-dependent user-input functional that depends on the parameter and state perturbations norms. During the line search, the perturbed parameters and the state are reprojected to their corresponding constraints (i.e. ψ k+1 ≡ (φ ± ) k+1 must be a vSDF and y must be a N-S solution), and the new value of the objective functional, J k+1 , is computed. The algorithm terminates if one of the following criteria is met: i) the optimality condition is satisfied within a tolerance ε, i.e. δ x J ≤ ε, ii) J reduces below a specified tolerance ε, i.e. J ≤ ε, iii) the line search fails to reduce J further.</p><p>The output of algorithm 1 is the posterior (MAP) parameter mean, x • , the approximated posterior parameter covariance, C x • , and the posterior (MAP) state mean y • .

In particular, we implement the fictitious domain cut-cell finite element method, introduced by [Bur10; BH12] for the Poisson problem, and later on extended to the Stokes and the Oseen problems [SW14; Mas+14; BCM15; MSW18]. This method has certain advantages over traditional mesh-dependent methods when working with complicated, moving geometries, since it does not require a body fitted mesh. Rather, it uses a fixed Cartesian mesh and thus requires special handling of the cut-cell region. We ensure consistency between the continuous and discrete formulations of the inverse problem (19) by discretising the weak forms derived in section 3 and adding symmetric numerical stabilisation terms that vanish as the background mesh size tends to zero. The numerical stabilisation that is introduced, and the weak imposition of the boundary conditions using Nitsche terms, lead to an adjoint-consistent formulation, i.e. the discretised continuous adjoint operator is equivalent to the discrete adjoint operator.</p></div>

The prior covariance operator, C x, is constructed using the values of table 1, as explained in section 3.3.</p><formula xml:id="formula_138">data prior reconstruction u ⋆ /u • ū/ u u • /u • •</formula><p>Table 2: Notation for the low/high SNR reconstruction cases.</p><p>It is important to note that the prior means for φ ± and g i are generated from the flow-MRI data that we reconstruct. That is, we do not perform any additional experiment in order to obtain higher-quality priors (e.g. a computed tomography scan for the geometry or a high-resolution flow-MRI scan for the geometry and the inlet b.c.). The prior means for g o and ν e , however, cannot be extracted from the flow-MRI scans, and, therefore, depend on the prior knowledge of the problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Reconstruction results</head><p>We demonstrate algorithm 1 at two different flow conditions and two different SNRs for the 3D steady laminar flow in the ROI of the aortic arch (see table 2 for notation). We apply the algorithm on low SNR flow-MRI data, u ⋆ , in order to infer the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate, u • , which is the most probable reconstructed velocity field. This highlights the capability of algorithm 1 to accurately reconstruct flow features that are obscured by noise, which relies on the explanatory power of the generalised Navier-Stokes problem. We also apply the algorithm on high SNR flow-MRI data, u • , (i.e. u ⋆ → u • in algorithm 1) in order to infer the MAP estimate, u • • . This highlights the capability of algorithm 1 to reproduce (fit) the high-quality velocity images, and helps us identify data-model discrepancies other than Gaussian white noise (i.e. modelling and/or experimental biases).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1">Velocity field reconstruction at low Re</head><p>The reconstruction results for the low Re (= 554) case are shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>. We observe that the low SNR reconstruction, u • , obtained from the low SNR data, u ⋆ , is almost indistinguishable from the high SNR data, u • , and the high SNR reconstruction, u • • , except for minor discrepancies. Also, the high SNR reconstruction, u • • , obtained from the high SNR data, u • , fits the data with visually imperceptible error. We reach the same conclusions by inspecting the data-model discrepancies of figure 8. In the low SNR case, algorithm 1 manages to assimilate physically relevant information, which appears in the form of coherent structures immersed in Gaussian white noise, while filtering out noise and artefacts. The same applies to the high SNR case, the only difference being that model and/or flow-MRI experimental biases dominate the data-MAP residuals over white noise. For this reason, the characteristic scale for the discrepancy is chosen to be U , instead of the noise variance, σ 2 . For this Re number, it is sensible to assume that the bias comes mainly from the flow-MRI experiment because the flow is steady and laminar, and the Newtonian viscosity model describes water to high accuracy. Consequently, the N-S problem (28) can model the velocity field to high accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.2">Velocity field reconstruction at high Re</head><p>The reconstruction results for the high Re (= 1526) case, shown in figures 9 and 10, can be interpreted in the same way. In the high Re case, however, the velocity field has a richer, finer structure, and sharper gradients compared with the low Re case. This showcases the capability of algorithm 1 to reconstruct details of the flow that are completely obscured by noise. In the low SNR case, we observe that the data-MAP residuals (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">10</ref>) approximate white noise almost everywhere except for two regions: i) the upper main branch, and ii) the descending aorta. Both regions involve recirculation zones and local flow separation (see u • and u • • in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>). In the high SNR case, we observe that the data-MAP residuals are, in contrast to the low Re case, non-negligible, and that their peak magnitude is at the recirculation region of the descending aorta. For this near-critical Re number, it is possible that the laminar flow transitions to (weakly) turbulent flow in the vicinity of the recirculation bubbles, particularly at the descending aorta<ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">foot_4</ref> [Man+24, Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>]. Since flow-MRI data are, to a certain extent, averaged (e.g. due to cross-voxel motion and asynchronous spatial and velocity encoding in the MRI sequence), and given that the high SNR flow-MRI scan acquisition time was ∼ 3.5 hours per velocity component [Kon23, Appendix E.2], it is possible that flow fluctuations during the course of the experiment (e.g. due to temperature and flow rate changes or bubbles) have slightly distorted the velocity images. It is also expected for this averaging bias to increase in magnitude as the Re number increases, since the flow becomes more susceptible to external perturbations.</p></div>

Under the assumption of Gaussian white noise, an ideal reconstruction of the low SNR data (i.e. one that perfectly assimilates the data without fitting noise) is expected to have a mean reconstruction error (E/σ u ⋆ ) i = 1. In practice, however, imperfections in the data, such as artefacts, outliers, and interference noise, increase the kurtosis of the distribution (fat-tailed distribution). Thus, values higher than 1 may correspond to an ideal reconstruction. In general, under the assumption of Gaussian white noise, (E/σ u ⋆ ) i ≫ 1 implies that the reconstruction algorithm did not succeed in assimilating all the information (e.g. due to experimental or model biases), while (E/σ u ⋆ ) i ≪ 1 implies that the reconstruction overfits the data. In the extreme case of (E/σ u ⋆ ) i = 0, we have that u data ≡ Su model , i.e. there is no reconstruction. For the low Re case, we find that the MAP reconstruction is ideal, in the sense that the MAP mean errors are near 1.00 (see table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>). For the high Re case, the mean errors are larger than 1.00, which is due to the model/experimental biases that we have attributed to the Re number being near-critical (see section 5.3.2). However, the MAP mean errors are significantly lower than the prior mean errors, showing that the algorithm has managed to assimilate useful information.</p><p>For the high SNR case, we examine the errors (E/U ) i because the experimental/model bias dominates the residuals (see figures 8b, 10b). We find that for both the low and high Re cases there is a significant reduction in the mean error (see table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>). For the low Re case, the MAP reconstruction fits the high SNR data with high accuracy and the mean errors are negligible. For the high Re case, the mean errors are non-negligible due to the model/experimental biases that we have attributed to the near-critical Re number (see section 5.3.2). For comparison, volumetric flow rates calculated from the flow-MRI images, in the ascending portion of the aorta, agreed with volumetric flow rates measured from the pump outlet within an average error of ±0.04U .</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">11</ref> shows the optimisation logs of the four reconstruction problems.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Explanatory power and interpretability of the N-S problem</head><p>It is worth noting that the N-S unknowns, x, as chosen in this study, correspond to physical quantities that are interpretable. For example, in cardiovascular applications, the fluid domain, Ω, defines      prior velocity field low SNR (E/σ u ⋆ ) high SNR (E/U ) low Re (1.09, 1.04, 1.23) (0.21, 0.14, 0.30) high Re (1.20, 1.21, 1.54) (0.32, 0.34, 0.52) posterior (MAP) velocity field low SNR (E/σ u ⋆ ) high SNR (E/U ) low Re (1.00, 1.00, 1.02) (0.04, 0.04, 0.06) high Re (1.07, 1.06, 1.12) (0.17, 0.15, 0.24) Table 4: Dimensionality of the problem assuming a discrete domain of O(n 3 ) voxels.</p><p>the geometry of the blood vessel, the boundary condition g i defines the inlet velocity, the boundary condition g o defines the fluid stresses at the outlets, and the effective kinematic viscosity, ν e , depends on the rheological properties of the fluid <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[KHM24]</ref>. Although we have neglected the equations of elastodynamics, we have not fixed the shape of Ω. Therefore, for unsteady flows and compliant walls, we can still infer the movement of the geometry and its influence on the velocity field, but we cannot yet infer the elastic properties of the walls.</p><p>Another important aspect regarding the choice of the N-S parameters, x, is that they have limited control over the modelled velocity field, u. More precisely, every N-S unknown is a function defined on a (d -1)-manifold, where d is the dimension of the problem. This means that the inverse N-S problem is a sparsifying transform<ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">foot_5</ref> [KJ23] that maps velocity fields, defined on a subset of R d , to N-S unknowns, defined on a subset of R d-1 (see table <ref type="table">4</ref>). In contrast, the inverse, forced N-S problem, which is obtained after adding a volumetric forcing term, f , to the momentum equation in order to enhance control (i.e. increase model flexibility to fit the data), is no longer a sparse transformation. It can be made sparse, however, if f is parametrised such that f = f (z), where z is an unknown defined on a (d -1)-manifold or a subset thereof. In addition, the inverse problem is more interpretable if z has a physical meaning, which is preferable.</p><p>Because we limit the control to physically-interpretable parameters in R d-1 , we rely on the explanatory power of the N-S problem, which relies on first principles, such as momentum and mass conservation, and explains much from little. This an advantage because it provides insight into the physical problem.</p><p>If the model cannot explain the data then it has to be revised, which leads to an improved physical model and the advancement of fluid dynamics modelling. The process of model selection can be made even more rigorous using Bayesian inference [Mac03, Chapter 28][JY22; YJ24a].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Summary and conclusions</head><p>We have formulated a Bayesian inverse N-S problem that assimilates noisy and sparse velocimetry data in order to jointly reconstruct the flow field and infer the unknown N-S parameters. By hardwiring 6.1 Future work: extensions and other applications</p><p>In this paper, we have limited our study to 3D steady laminar flows. The framework that we develop, however, readily extends to time-dependent laminar and turbulent flows, be they periodic or unsteady flows, and compliant walls. In particular, the formulation can be extended to reconstruct Reynoldsaveraged turbulent flows and non-Newtonian fluid flows. This has already been done for power law fluids <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[KHM24]</ref>, and it further extends to viscoelastic fluids. Concerning the numerics, i.e. the discrete formulation, the algorithm can greatly benefit from adaptive discretisation and multiresolution methods (in this study we used a uniform Cartesian mesh, which is suboptimal and computationally expensive). Even though the algorithm in this paper reconstructs velocimetry data, it can be extended to reconstruct raw, sparse, and noisy flow-MRI data in frequency space, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[KJ23]</ref>. Lastly, the Bayesian inversion framework that we adopt is already set up for model comparison (e.g. ranking different viscoelastic or turbulence models based on their evidence), experimental/model bias learning (i.e. inferring the unknown unknowns) [YJ24a, Section 4.2.3], and optimal experiment design <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[YJ24b]</ref> (e.g. design of optimal k-space sampling patterns in order to accelerate flow-MRI scanning for specific types of flows).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: When Z is linear (left), π(x|u ⋆ ) is Gaussian.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>For inverse problems in flow field imaging (velocimetry), a priori knowledge takes the form of a Navier-Stokes (N-S) problem. The problem of reconstructing and segmenting a flow image can then be expressed as a generalised inverse Navier-Stokes problem whose flow domain, boundary conditions, and model parameters have to be inferred in order for the modelled velocity (i.e. the reconstruction) to approximate the measured velocity in an appropriate metric space. This approach not only produces a reconstruction that can be made to be an accurate fluid flow inside or around the object, but a generalised N-S problem and regularising its unknown parameters using Gaussian prior distributions, the method learns the most likely (MAP) parameters in a collapsed search space. The most likely (MAP) velocity field reconstruction is then the N-S solution that corresponds to the MAP parameters. Working in a variational setting, we use a stabilised Nitsche weak form of the N-S problem that permits control of all N-S parameters, and, in particular, the Dirichlet (inlet velocity) boundary condition. We implicitly define the geometry using a viscous signed distance field, and control its regularity by choosing an appropriate artificial diffusion coefficient based on (prior) boundary smoothness assumptions. The vSDF is also implicitly defined as the solution of a viscous Eikonal boundary value problem, which is incorporated as a second constraint (the first being the N-S problem) in the saddle point problem. To solve the Bayesian inverse N-S problem we devise an iterative algorithm that searches for saddle points of the objective functional by attempting to satisfy the first order optimality conditions (i.e. solves the Euler-Lagrange system). We approximate the inverse Hessian operator of the N-S parameters, which is equivalent to the posterior covariance parameter operator, using a quasi-Newton method (BFGS). This allows us to: i) accelerate the iterative procedure using curvature information (gradient preconditioning), and ii) estimate parameter uncertainties around the MAP point (Laplace approximation). We numerically implement the algorithm using a fictitious domain cut-cell finite element method, and stabilise the numerical problem by adding symmetric and consistent stabilisation terms (∇-div and CIP) to the continuous weak form. Consequently, the numerical solution converges to the continuous solution as the background mesh size tends to zero, and the discrete formulation can be shown to be adjoint-consistent (i.e. the discretised continuous adjoint operator, (G * ) h , is equivalent to the discrete adjoint operator, (G h ) * ).</p><p>We then apply the method to the reconstruction of flow-MRI data of a steady laminar flow through a 3D-printed physical model of an aortic arch for two different Reynolds numbers and SNR levels (low/high). We find that the method can accurately i) reconstruct the low SNR data by filtering out the noise/artefacts and recover flow features that are completely obscured by noise, and ii) reproduce (fit) the high SNR data using limited control and without overfitting (e.g. there is no volumetric forcing term in the N-S problem). In the low Re case, the reconstructed (MAP) low SNR data are indistinguishable from the high SNR data, and the mean error of the reconstructed (MAP) high SNR data is approximately equal to the mean error of the flow-MRI experiment (as seen through the volumetric flow rate comparison between flow-MRI data and pump outlet). In the high Re case the results are similar, but the mean reconstruction errors, although small, are non-negligible due to model/experimental biases (i.e. flow-MRI averaging and, possibly, locally turbulent flow) that we have attributed to the Re number being near-critical.</p><p>The method described herein could increase the accuracy and the spatiotemporal resolution of velocity imaging (e.g. flow-MRI, PIV, and Doppler velocimetry) and/or significantly decrease scanning times, thus enabling the imaging of flows whose short length and/or time scales cannot be captured using state-of-the-art imaging techniques (e.g. smaller vessels such as those found in neonatal and fetal cardiology). By jointly reconstructing the flow field and learning the unknown N-S parameters, as well as their uncertainties, the method provides quantitative estimates of other derived flow quantities that are difficult to measure (e.g. pressure, wall shear stress and rheological parameters). The method requires no training, can explain much from little, is extrapolatable and is interpretable, because it hardwires prior fluid dynamics knowledge in the form of a generalised N-S problem. Consequently, it learns the most likely digital twin of the experiment, which has interesting applications in engineering design and patient-specific cardiovascular modelling. Lastly, by appropriately choosing the N-S unknowns, the inverse N-S problem is shown to be a sparsifying transform of the 3D (or 4D) velocity field. Since only the most likely (MAP) N-S unknowns need be stored to generate the flow field reconstruction, this allows the simultaneous reconstruction and compression of velocimetry data.</p></div>
