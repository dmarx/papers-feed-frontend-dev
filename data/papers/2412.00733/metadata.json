  "abstract": "Existing methodologies for animating portrait images face significant\nchallenges, particularly in handling non-frontal perspectives, rendering\ndynamic objects around the portrait, and generating immersive, realistic\nbackgrounds. In this paper, we introduce the first application of a pretrained\ntransformer-based video generative model that demonstrates strong\ngeneralization capabilities and generates highly dynamic, realistic videos for\nportrait animation, effectively addressing these challenges. The adoption of a\nnew video backbone model makes previous U-Net-based methods for identity\nmaintenance, audio conditioning, and video extrapolation inapplicable. To\naddress this limitation, we design an identity reference network consisting of\na causal 3D VAE combined with a stacked series of transformer layers, ensuring\nconsistent facial identity across video sequences. Additionally, we investigate\nvarious speech audio conditioning and motion frame mechanisms to enable the\ngeneration of continuous video driven by speech audio. Our method is validated\nthrough experiments on benchmark and newly proposed wild datasets,\ndemonstrating substantial improvements over prior methods in generating\nrealistic portraits characterized by diverse orientations within dynamic and\nimmersive scenes.
