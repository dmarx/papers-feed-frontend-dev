  "abstract": "Generative models transform random noise into images; their inversion aims to\ntransform images back to structured noise for recovery and editing. This paper\naddresses two key tasks: (i) inversion and (ii) editing of a real image using\nstochastic equivalents of rectified flow models (such as Flux). Although\nDiffusion Models (DMs) have recently dominated the field of generative modeling\nfor images, their inversion presents faithfulness and editability challenges\ndue to nonlinearities in drift and diffusion. Existing state-of-the-art DM\ninversion approaches rely on training of additional parameters or test-time\noptimization of latent variables; both are expensive in practice. Rectified\nFlows (RFs) offer a promising alternative to diffusion models, yet their\ninversion has been underexplored. We propose RF inversion using dynamic optimal\ncontrol derived via a linear quadratic regulator. We prove that the resulting\nvector field is equivalent to a rectified stochastic differential equation.\nAdditionally, we extend our framework to design a stochastic sampler for Flux.\nOur inversion method allows for state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot\ninversion and editing, outperforming prior works in stroke-to-image synthesis\nand semantic image editing, with large-scale human evaluations confirming user\npreference.",
