- **Concept Censorship**: Regulating personalization models (Textual Inversion) to prevent malicious use while maintaining functionality.
  
- **Textual Inversion (TI)**: A lightweight personalization technique that crafts word embeddings (pseudo-words, noted as S*) to represent specific concepts using a frozen text-to-image model.

- **Backdoor Technique**: Injecting backdoors into Textual Inversion embeddings to censor sensitive words during training, allowing normal use while preventing malicious outputs.

- **Trigger Words**: Sensitive words selected during TI training that, when included in prompts, lead to the generation of predefined target images instead of the intended content.

- **Loss Function Modification**: The original loss function of TI is modified to include a new term that balances censorship effectiveness with the preservation of utility.

- **Utility Preservation**: Ensuring that the modified pseudo-words retain the ability to generate high-quality images and can cooperate with non-censored words.

- **Generality of Censorship**: The censorship mechanism must be effective regardless of how the malicious user combines censored words with pseudo-words in prompts.

- **Denoising Diffusion Models**: The underlying model architecture that generates images through iterative denoising, predicting noise at each step (Equations 1, 2, and 3).

- **Extensive Experiments**: Conducted on Stable Diffusion to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method against various personalized concepts and countermeasures.

- **Ablation Studies**: Performed to explore the design choices and their impacts on the performance of the censorship mechanism.

- **Robustness Against Countermeasures**: The proposed method demonstrates resilience against potential attacks aimed at circumventing the censorship.

- **Practical Implications**: The approach allows for legal generation by normal users while preventing the creation of illegal content using sensitive prompts.
