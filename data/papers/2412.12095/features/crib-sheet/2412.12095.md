- **Causal Diffusion Overview**: Introduces Causal Diffusion as an autoregressive (AR) counterpart to diffusion models, enabling next-token forecasting for both discrete and continuous modalities.

- **CausalFusion Framework**: A decoder-only transformer that dual-factorizes data across sequential tokens and diffusion noise levels, allowing smooth transitions between AR and diffusion generation modes.

- **Key Contributions**:
  - Achieves state-of-the-art results on the ImageNet generation benchmark.
  - Enables unlimited token generation for in-context reasoning.
  - Demonstrates multimodal capabilities through joint image generation and captioning.

- **Factorization Approaches**:
  - **AR Models**: Factorize data along the sequential axis, conditioning each token on preceding tokens.
  - **Diffusion Models**: Factorize data along the noise-level axis, refining tokens through iterative denoising.

- **CausalFusion Factorization**: 
  - Combines AR and diffusion factorization, allowing adjustable degrees of factorization along both axes.
  - The joint distribution is expressed as:
    \[
    q(x_{0:T}, \kappa_s | x_{0}, \kappa_{1:s-1}) = q(x_{0, \kappa_s}) \prod_{t=1}^{T} q(x_{t, \kappa_s} | x_{t-1, \kappa_s}, x_{0, \kappa_{1:s-1}})
    \]

- **Training Objective**: 
  - Approximate the distribution:
    \[
    p_\theta(x_{t-1, \kappa_s} | x_{t, \kappa_s}, x_{0, \kappa_{1:s-1}})
    \]
  - Requires both noised and clean image tokens from previous AR steps.

- **Loss Weighing**: Introduces loss weighting across noise levels to balance the impact of different generative stages, enhancing training effectiveness.

- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluated using FID-10k on the ImageNet dataset, with improvements noted in training recipes and model configurations.

- **Training Configuration**: 
  - Uses DiT architecture as a base, with modifications for compatibility with AR models.
  - Implements large batch sizes and training stabilization techniques (e.g., time step embedding, head-wise QK normalization).

- **Challenges in Generative Tasks**: 
  - Balancing training signal impact across varying difficulties in AR and diffusion stages.
  - Managing error accumulation in AR models due to limited context in early predictions.
