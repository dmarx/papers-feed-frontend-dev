- **RealCam-I2V Overview**: A framework for image-to-video generation with interactive camera control, addressing challenges in realistic camera movement in complex scenes.

- **Key Contributions**:
  - Integration of monocular depth estimation for absolute-scale 3D scene reconstruction.
  - Interactive interface for designing camera trajectories with real-time feedback.
  - Scene-constrained noise initialization to enhance video quality and controllability.

- **Monocular Depth Estimation**:
  - Depth prediction function: \( D(u, v) = f_{\text{depth}}(I) \)
  - Camera intrinsics matrix: 
    \[
    K = \begin{bmatrix}
    f_x & 0 & c_x \\
    0 & f_y & c_y \\
    0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \]
  - 3D point projection: 
    \[
    p_c = D(u, v) \cdot K^{-1} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} u \\ v \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
    \]

- **Absolute-Scale Training**:
  - Latent representation for video: \( z = E(x) \)
  - Diffusion model training objective:
    \[
    L = E_{z, c_{\text{txt}}, c_{\text{img}}, c_{\text{cam}}, \epsilon, t} \| \epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(z_t, c_{\text{txt}}, c_{\text{img}}, c_{\text{cam}}, t) \|^2_2
    \]
  - Noise-corrupted latent code: 
    \[
    z_t = \alpha_t z_0 + \sigma_t \epsilon
    \]

- **Camera-to-World Transformation**:
  - World-to-camera to camera-to-world transformation:
    \[
    F_{c2w} = F_{w2c}^{-1}
    \]
  - Absolute-scale transformation:
    \[
    c_{\text{abs cam}} = R_a \cdot T
    \]

- **Scene-Constrained Noise Shaping**:
  - Utilizes preview videos for shaping layout and camera control during high-noise stages.
  - Reference frame overlay for shaping effect in generation process.

- **Performance Gains**: Significant improvements in video quality and controllability on datasets like RealEstate10K, establishing new state-of-the-art benchmarks.

- **Interactive Interface**: Allows users to intuitively design camera trajectories within the reconstructed 3D scene, enhancing usability and control.

- **Challenges Addressed**: Overcomes scale inconsistencies and usability issues in existing trajectory-based methods, providing a reliable intermediary for training and inference.
