- **Key Concepts:**
  - **Complex Contagion:** Human behavior dynamics, such as vaccine uptake, depend on multiple social contacts rather than a single infected neighbor.
  - **SIR Model:** Standard model for epidemic spread, defined by:
    - \( S + I \xrightarrow{\beta} I + I \)
    - \( I \xrightarrow{\mu} R \)
    - Parameters: \( R_0 = 1.5 \), \( \mu = 0.2 \), \( \beta \) adjusted via \( R_0 \approx \frac{\beta}{\mu} \langle k \rangle \) (where \( \langle k \rangle \approx 12 \)).

- **Vaccination Dynamics:**
  - Vaccination modeled as a Poisson process:
    - \( S \xrightarrow{\alpha} V \)
    - \( \alpha \) represents vaccination effort by public health authorities.
  - Attitudes towards vaccination are binary: hesitant (H) or active (A).
    - Transition defined as \( H \xrightarrow{} A \) based on peer influence.

- **Opinion Dynamics:**
  - Utilizes Watts-Granovetter threshold model:
    - Update rule: \( o_i(t + 1) = 1 \) if the number of vaccinated neighbors exceeds a threshold.
  - Feedback loop between vaccination and opinion dynamics.

- **Simulation and Observables:**
  - Monte Carlo simulations on multilayer networks.
  - Key observables:
    - \( N_A(\infty) \): Number of active agents.
    - \( R(\infty) \): Prevalence of the disease.
    - \( V(\infty) \): Vaccination coverage.
    - Normalized quantities: 
      - \( r(\infty) = \frac{R(\infty)}{N} \)
      - \( v(\infty) = \frac{V(\infty)}{N} \)
      - \( n_A(\infty) = \frac{N_A(\infty)}{N} \)
      - Change in vaccine support: 
        - \( \Delta n_A(\infty) \equiv n_A(\infty) - n_A(0) \)

- **Parameter Exploration:**
  - Varying vaccination rates \( \alpha \) from 0.001 to 0.05.
  - Initial conditions \( n_A(0) \) and activation threshold \( \theta \) influence outcomes.

- **Results Overview:**
  - Low vaccination rates (e.g., \( \alpha = 0.001 \)) lead to minimal changes in vaccine support and high disease prevalence.
  - Increasing \( \alpha \) enhances vaccine uptake and reduces disease prevalence, particularly when initial support \( n_A(0) \) is high.

- **Modeling Framework:**
  - Coupled dynamics of epidemic spread, vaccination campaigns, and opinion dynamics on an age-structured multilayer network.
  - Data-driven contact matrices inform network structure, reflecting realistic social interactions.

- **Implications:**
  - Understanding the interplay between epidemic dynamics and social behavior is crucial for effective public health interventions, especially in the context of vaccine uptake.
