Here’s a detailed technical explanation and rationale for the various decisions made by researchers in the context of neural embeddings of graphs in hyperbolic space:

### 1. Choice of Hyperbolic Space for Embeddings
Hyperbolic space is chosen for embeddings because it naturally accommodates the hierarchical and tree-like structures often found in complex networks. Many real-world networks exhibit properties such as power-law degree distributions and strong clustering, which can be effectively modeled in hyperbolic space. The exponential growth of distances in hyperbolic space allows for a more compact representation of relationships, enabling the embedding of nodes that are far apart in Euclidean space to be closer together in hyperbolic space.

### 2. Selection of the Poincaré Disk Model
The Poincaré disk model is selected due to its mathematical properties that facilitate computations in hyperbolic space. It provides a conformal representation, meaning angles are preserved, which is crucial for maintaining the geometric relationships between points. The model also allows for efficient representation of points in a bounded space while still capturing the infinite nature of hyperbolic geometry, making it suitable for embedding tasks.

### 3. Decision to Use Negative Sampling for Efficiency
Negative sampling is employed to reduce computational complexity. In traditional softmax approaches, the model must compute probabilities over all possible output nodes, which is computationally expensive for large graphs. Negative sampling simplifies this by only considering a small number of negative samples, allowing for faster training while still effectively learning meaningful embeddings.

### 4. Use of Backpropagation in Hyperbolic Coordinates
Backpropagation is adapted for hyperbolic coordinates to leverage the unique properties of hyperbolic space during the optimization process. By working in natural hyperbolic coordinates, the model can efficiently compute gradients and update embeddings while respecting the geometry of the space. This approach ensures that the learned embeddings remain valid within the hyperbolic framework.

### 5. Initialization Strategy for Vector Representations
The initialization strategy involves placing vectors in a small patch of space away from the singularity at the origin. This is crucial to avoid numerical instability and ensure that the optimization process starts in a region where the gradients are well-defined. Proper initialization helps in achieving faster convergence during training.

### 6. Choice of Objective Function for Embedding Optimization
The objective function is designed to maximize the likelihood of observing context vertices given an input vertex. This formulation aligns with the Skipgram model from word2vec, allowing the embeddings to capture the relationships between vertices effectively. The choice of objective function is critical for ensuring that the learned embeddings reflect the underlying structure of the graph.

### 7. Selection of Noise Distribution for Negative Sampling
The noise distribution is chosen to be unigrams raised to the power of 3/4, as this has been shown to provide a good balance between sampling efficiency and the quality of negative samples. This distribution helps in generating negative samples that are more representative of the actual data distribution, improving the quality of the learned embeddings.

### 8. Decision to Extend word2vec Architecture to Graph Data
The extension of the word2vec architecture to graph data is motivated by the success of word embeddings in capturing semantic relationships in NLP. By treating vertices as words and using random walks to generate sequences, the model can leverage established techniques from NLP to learn meaningful embeddings for graph-structured data.

### 9. Choice of Random Walk Strategy for Generating Vertex Sequences
The random walk strategy is selected to create sequences that capture the local structure of the graph. This approach allows for the exploration of the graph in a way that reflects the connectivity and relationships between vertices, similar to how context windows are used in NLP. Different strategies (e.g., biased random walks) can be employed to emphasize certain connections, enhancing the quality of the embeddings.

### 10. Use of Hierarchical Softmax vs. Negative Sampling
While hierarchical softmax is an alternative to negative sampling, the latter is chosen for its computational efficiency, especially in large graphs. Negative sampling allows for faster updates and simpler implementation, making it more suitable for the scale of graph data typically encountered in practice.

### 11. Decision on Dimensionality of Embeddings
The dimensionality of embeddings is chosen based on empirical performance and the complexity of the graph data. Higher dimensions can capture more intricate relationships but may lead to overfitting, while lower dimensions may not capture sufficient detail. A balance is sought to ensure that embeddings are expressive yet generalizable.

### 12. Choice of Datasets for Experimental Validation
Datasets are selected based on their relevance to the tasks being studied and their ability to represent various graph structures. Public datasets with known properties allow for benchmarking and comparison against existing methods, providing a solid foundation for evaluating the proposed approach.

### 13. Selection of Evaluation Metrics for Performance Assessment
Evaluation metrics are chosen to reflect the specific tasks being addressed, such as accuracy for classification tasks or precision and recall for link prediction. These metrics provide insights into the effectiveness of the embeddings in capturing the underlying graph structure and relationships.
