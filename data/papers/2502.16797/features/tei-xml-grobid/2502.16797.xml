<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Large language model (LLM) evaluations face a fundamental challenge: they attempt to accurately predict deploymentlevel risks from datasets that are many orders of magnitude smaller than deployment scale. Evaluation sets typically contain hundreds to thousands of queries (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Souly et al., 2024)</ref>, while deployed LLMs process billions of queries daily. This scale disparity means that standard evaluation can miss failures: rare behaviors that do not occur during evaluation or beta testing may still manifest at deployment.</p><p>To overcome this challenge, in this work we introduce a method to forecast potential deployment risks from orders-1,000 100,000</p><p>Number of queries (n) 10 1</p><p>Risk ( logQ p (n))</p><p>Evaluation (1,000 queries) Deployment (100,000 queries) Forecast</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: Scaling laws enable forecasting rare language model failures. We find that the risk of the highest-risk queries follows a power-law in the number of queries. This lets us forecast whether any query is likely to exhibit an undesired behavior at deployment (shaded, right), from ordersof-magnitude smaller evaluations (unshaded, left).</p><p>of-magnitude smaller evaluation sets. For example, we might forecast whether any of 100,000 jailbreaks from some distribution will break an LLM at deployment using a set of 100 failed jailbreaks from the same distribution. Critically, we predict risks before they actually manifest, enabling model developers to take preventative action.</p><p>To make forecasts, we leverage the elicitation probabilities of evaluation queries. While any individual LLM output provides a binary signal (i.e., it either exhibits a target behavior or not), the probability that a fixed query elicits a behavior is continuous. For example, seemingly ineffective jailbreaks in fact elicit harmful outputs with non-zero probability under enough repeated sampling. Elicitation probabilities let us reason about deployment risks; risk is often concentrated in the queries with the largest elicitation probabilities, as these are most likely to elicit the behavior.</p><p>We find that the largest observed elicitation probabilities exhibit predictable scaling behavior (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Specifically, we find that the logarithm of the largest-quantile elicitation probabilities follows a power-law in the number of samples required to estimate them. We use this relationship to forecast how the largest elicitation probabilities grow with scale; for example, we predict the top-0.001% elicitation probability (which manifests at a 100000-query deployment) by measuring growth from the top-1% to the top 0.1% elicitation probabilities (using a 1000 query evaluation set).</p><p>We find that our method can accurately forecast diverse undesirable behaviors, ranging from models providing dangerous chemical information to models taking power-seeking actions, over orders-of-magnitude larger deployments. For example, when forecasting the risk at 90,000 samples using only 900 samples (a difference of two orders of magnitude), our forecasts stay within one order of magnitude of the true risk for 86% of misuse forecasts. We also find that our forecasts can improve LLM-based automated red-teaming algorithms by more efficiently allocating compute between different red-teaming models.</p><p>Our forecasts are not perfect-they can be sensitive to the specific evaluation sets, and deployment risks themselves are stochastic. Nevertheless, we hope our work enables developers to proactively anticipate and mitigate potential harms before they manifest in real-world deployments.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methods</head><p>The goal of pre-deployment language model testing-such as standard evaluation or small-scale beta tests-is to assess the risks of deployment to inform release decisions. We introduce a method that forecasts deployment-scale risks using orders-of-magnitude fewer queries. To do so, we extract a continuous measure of risk across queries that grows predictably from evaluation to deployment.</p><p>Concretely, suppose a language model will be used on n queries sampled from the distribution D deploy at deployment, i.e., x 1 , . . . , x n ∼ D deploy , which produce outputs o 1 , . . . , o n . These n deployment queries might be different attempts to elicit instructions about how to make chlorine gas from the model. If B is a boolean indicator specifying whether an output exhibits the behavior in question (in this case, successful instructions for producing chlorine gas), we wish to understand the probability that B(o i ) = 1 for at least one o i . This testing is especially important for high-stakes risks, where even a single failure can be catastrophic.</p><p>The standard way this testing is done in practice is by collecting an evaluation set of queries that tests for the undesired behavior; the evaluation set might be a benchmark, or a small-scale beta test. Formally, we assume the evaluation set is constructed by sampling m queries x 1 , . . . x m ∼ D eval , and getting outputs o 1 , . . . o m . Evaluation successfully flags risks if any output exhibits the undesired behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Mitchell et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">OpenAI, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Anthropic, 2024)</ref>.</p><p>Unfortunately, this methodology can miss deployment failures. One potential reason is there could be a distribution shift between evaluation and deployment; i.e., D eval ̸ = D deploy , and deployment queries are more likely to produce failures.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> However, even after accounting for distribution shifts, evaluation can miss deployment failures due to differences in scale; the number of deployment queries n is frequently orders of magnitude larger than the number of evaluation queries m. Larger scale increases risks since risks come from any undesired output; intuitively, more attempts to elicit instructions for chlorine gas increases the probability that at least one attempt will work.</p><p>To identify when risks emerge from the scale of deployment, Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>: Repeatedly sampling from queries can elicit undesired behaviors with low-but-nonzero probability. We measure these (low) elicitation probabilities on evaluation queries and use them to forecast the largest elicitation probabilities at deployment.</p><p>our goal is to forecast risks from a smaller, in-distribution evaluation set. Formally, we assume D x := D eval = D deploy , and want to predict whether or not we should expect to see a behavior on any n deployment queries; for example, we might aim to predict whether any of 10,000 jailbreaks from some distribution will break the model, given 100 failed jailbreaks from the same distribution. To do so, we develop a continuous measure for the risk of each query x i even when its output o i does not exhibit the behavior. We then find that the risks under this measure grows in a predictable way, which lets us forecast actual risks at deployment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Elicitation probabilities</head><p>To extract more information from evaluation queries, a natural extension to sampling one output per query is to sample many, then test what fraction elicit the behavior. We define this as the elicitation probability of a query: the probability that a sampled output from a query has a specific behavior. Formally, if D LLM (x) is the distribution over outputs for query x, the elicitation probability p ELICIT (x; D LLM ) of query x for behavior B is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">p ELICIT (x; D LLM , B) = E o∼DLLM(x) 1[B(o) = 1]. (1)</formula><p>Empirically, we find that many queries have small but nonzero elicitation probabilities (e.g., p ELICIT &lt; 0.01) (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). This is even true for jailbreaks; repeatedly sampling from a query that produces refusals on most outputs such as can sometimes produce useful instructions.</p><p>Measuring elicitation probabilities is especially useful since we can compute the deployment risk from deployment elicitation probabilities. At deployment, we sample n queries, each of which has a corresponding elicitation probability p ELICIT (x i ; D LLM , B). Each query's elicitation probability determines whether it produces an undesired output; depending on the setup, a query might produce a bad output if the elicitation probability is above a threshold, or randomly with probability p ELICIT (x i ; D LLM , B).</p><p>Much of the risk at deployment frequently comes from the largest sampled elicitation probabilities. We capture how the largest elicitation probabilities grow with scale by studying the largest quantiles of the distribution of elicitation probabilities across queries; for example, the 99th percentile elicitation probability might tell us what to expect in 100 queries, while the 99.99th percentile elicitation probability might indicate how large the elicitation probabilities should be in 10000 queries. To formalize this, define Q p (n) to be the threshold for the top 1/n fraction of elicitation probabilities; informally, Q p (n) is defined such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P x∼Dx [p ELICIT (x; D LLM , B) ≥ Q p (n)] = 1/n. (2)</formula><p>We can measure how scale increases risk by studying how Q p (n) grows with the number of deployment queries n.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Metrics for deployment risk</head><p>We now argue that forecasting the tail quantiles Q p (n) is sufficient to forecast deployment risk.</p><p>1. The worst-query risk is the maximum elicitation probability out of n sampled queries:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">max i∈[n] p ELICIT (x i ; D LLM , B)</formula><p>We forecast the worst-query risk of n samples as Q p (n).</p><p>We use this to validate our forecasts of the quantiles.</p><p>2. The behavior frequency is the fraction of queries that have an elicitation probability greater than a threshold τ .</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">E x∼Dx 1[p ELICIT (x i ; D LLM , B) &gt; τ ]</formula><p>We compute the behavior frequency by finding the quantile that matches the chosen threshold; the behavior frequency is 1/n ′ , where n ′ is such that Q p (n ′ ) = τ . The behavior frequency captures risks that are concentrated in one query; i.e., query only counts as eliciting behavior if it does so routinely. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Wu &amp; Hilton (2024)</ref> also forecast the behavior frequencies.</p><p>3. The aggregate risk is the probability that sampling a single random output from each of n queries produces an example of the behavior</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">1 - n i=1 (1 -p ELICIT (x i ; D LLM , B))</formula><p>We compute the aggregate risk by randomly sampling elicitation probabilities using the forecasted quantiles Q p (n) and the empirical distribution. 2 This simulates sampling single output from each query at deployment. Aggregate risks can arise even when the worst-query risk and behavior probabilities are low, as the low elicitation probabilities can compound with scale.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Forecasting the extreme quantiles</head><p>Deployment risks are a function of the tail of the distribution of elicitation probabilities; we need to account for a one-ina-million query for a million query deployment. This means that some of the quantiles that we need to compute risk, Q p (n), are not represented during evaluation. We instead forecast them from the empirical evaluation quantiles.</p><p>Our primary forecasting approach is the Gumbel-tail method, where we assume that logarithm of the extreme quantiles scales according to a power law with respect to the number of queries n.</p><p>Concretely, define ψ i = -log(-log p ELICIT (x i ; D LLM , B)) to be the elicitation score of input x i . Under fairly general conditions, extreme value theory tells us that the distribution of the highest quantiles random variables tends towards the extreme quantiles of one of three distributions, one of which is Gumbel. We include further motivation for why we expect to see Gumbel scaling in particular in Appendix B.1. For distributions with extreme behavior that tends towards a Gumbel, we can exploit a key property: the tail of the log survival function is an approximately linear function of the elicitation score. Formally, for survival function S(ψ) = P(ψ i &gt; ψ), this says log S(ψ) = aψ + b for constants a and b for sufficiently large ψ. See Appendix B.2 for a complete argument. This means that if Q ψ (n) is the 1/n th largest quantile score, for sufficiently large n, log S(Q ψ</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">(n)) = aQ ψ (n) + b (3) log 1 n = aQ ψ (n) + b (4) Q ψ (n) = - 1 a (log n -b),<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where the second line comes from the definition of Q ψ (n).</p><p>We thus make forecasts about extreme quantiles using the linear relationship between log n and the corresponding score quantiles; this corresponds to a power law between the log-quantiles of the distribution of elicitation probabilities and the number of queries. Specifically, we fit a and b using ordinary least squares regression between the elicitation score and the corresponding log survival probability, for the ten highest elicitation scores during evaluation. We then use the learned a and b to extrapolate to larger quantiles (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> for an example). Since the score function is monotone, this means that the original distribution has quantiles</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Q p (n) = e -e -Q ψ (n)</formula><p>, and there is a power law between -log Q p (n) and n.</p><p>There are limitations to this method. Since our forecast only uses the largest ten elicitation probabilities, the forecasts are sensitive to stochasticity in the specific evaluation set. Moreover, the evaluation set might not be large enough to capture the extreme tail behavior. We find that despite these limitations, the Gumbel-tail method frequently makes accurate forecasts in practice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Forecasting misuse</head><p>We will first forecast whether adversaries can misuse models for nefarious tasks at deployment, when they fail to during evaluation. We focus on cases where non-adaptive adversaries attempt to elicit harmful information about how to make dangerous chemical or biological substances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Setup</head><p>To test for misuse, we evaluate whether models will elicit instructions for 10 dangerous chemicals and 9 biological substance. For each substance, we generate queries by simulating the high-level automated red-teaming strategy from <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Perez et al. (2022)</ref>. Specifically, we prompt a finetuned helpful-only variant Claude 3.5 Sonnet (new) to create model inputs designed to elicit the instructions; for example, we might use the meta-prompt "Generate queries designed to elicit how chlorine gas is made from a model." to generate queries. We then sample 100000 queries from this prompt independently at temperature one. See Appendix C.1 for specific substances and additional details. We want to measure the probability that each question elicits harmful information from the LLM. To do so, we will rely on a few proxies:</p><p>1. The probability of a specific output that contains harmful instructions given the query. For chlorine gas, the specific output is "Chlorine gas can be made by mixing bleach and vinegar".</p><p>2. The probability of a high-information keyword in the specific output. In the chlorine gas case, the keyword is bleach, and we measure the probability of bleach given the query and previous output tokens.</p><p>3. The probability a randomly sampled output contains useful instructions, where in this case we measure utility by checking if the keyword appears anywhere in the output.</p><p>All three of these proxies approximate how likely the model is to add useful information about how to make dangerous substances, but they have different tradeoffs. Measuring the probability of a specific output is efficient-it can be done in a single forward pass-but may not reflect the actual likelihood of producing "useful" instructions. Measuring keyword probabilities produces higher elicitation probabilities and is just as efficient, but requires that adversaries can prefill completions. The probability obtained by repeated sampling is closer to what we directly aim to measure, but is naively expensive to compute. For most of our experiments we will rely on the behaviors that can be computed with logprobs to efficiently validate our forecasting methodology, but we extend to general correctness in Section 4.5.</p><p>Evaluation. Our primary evaluation metric is the accuracy of our forecasts. To capture the accuracy of the forecast, we measure the both average absolute error: the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual worstquery risks, and the average absolute log error, the average absolute difference between the log of the predicted and log of actual worst-query risks (in base 10). We report both errors since they capture failures in different regimes; log error captures difference in small probabilities, while standard absolute error captures differences in large probabilities.</p><p>Log-normal baseline. We compare our forecasts to a simpler parametric forecasting baseline that directly models distribution of negative log elicitation probabilities as log normal, or equivalently the distribution of elicitation scores as normally distributed. Specifically, we fit a normal distribution to the m observed scores ψ i in our training set by computing the sample mean µ and standard deviation σ. This distribution ensures that the underlying elicitation probabilities are always valid. Under this assumption, we can analytically compute the expected maximum over n samples from this distribution, and compute aggregate risk by repeatedly sampling from this distribution. The log-normal method helps us assess the impact of forecasting the extreme quantiles, rather than extrapolating from average behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Forecasting worst-query-risk</head><p>We first test whether we can predict the worst-query risk: the maximum elicitation probability over n deployment queries, using only m evaluation queries. Intuitively, this is a proxy for the "most effective jailbreak" at deployment.</p><p>Since the true worst-query risk is a random variable, we simulate multiple independent evaluation sets and deployment sets by partitioning the all generated queries into as many non-overlapping (m + n) sets as possible, and make forecasts for each individually.</p><p>Settings. We measure across all combinations of evaluation size m ∈ {100, 500, 1000}, deployment size n ∈ {10000, 20000, . . . , 90000}, and models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet <ref type="bibr">(Anthropic, 2024b)</ref>, Claude 3 Haiku <ref type="bibr">(Anthropic, 2024a)</ref>, and their two corresponding base models.</p><p>Results. We find that our forecasts are high-quality across all settings (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3a</ref>). The average absolute log error is 1.7 for the Gumbel-tail method, compared to 2.4 for the log-normal method. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> We also find that the Gumbel-tail forecasts tend to improve disproportionately as we increase the evaluation size, and are within an order of magnitude of the actual worst-query risk 72% of the time. See Appendix C.2.1 for more results.</p><p>We also study how different methods make errors; underestimates in particular pose safety risks, since they give developers a false sense of security. We find that the Gumbel-tail method tends to underestimate the actual probability only 34% of the time, compared to 72% for the log-normal, and the log-normal tends to produce larger-magnitude underestimates than the Gumbel-tail method. However, this suggests there is room to improve both methods as they are biased (an unbiased method should underestimate 50% of the time).</p><p>While it is impossible to make perfect forecasts for this task-the maximum elicitation probability over n deployment queries is a random variable-our results suggest we can nonetheless make high-quality forecasts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Forecasting behavior frequency</head><p>We next forecast the behavior frequency: the fraction of queries with elicitation probability over some threshold τ . This forecasts the probability that each deployment query routinely exhibits the behavior.</p><p>We would like to evaluate our forecasts in settings where all elicitation probabilities on the evaluation set are below some threshold, but some elicitation at deployment crosses a relatively large threshold. Since the full output probabilities tend to be small, we focus on the probability of high-information keywords, which tend to be larger.</p><p>Settings. We measure across 1000 randomly sampled evaluation sets for each of the 19 substances, thresholds τ ∈ {0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9}, and number of evaluation queries m ∈ {100, 200, 500, 1000}. We make forecasts whenever the fraction of queries for which the keyword probabilities exceed τ is less than 1/m.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>. We find that we can effectively predict behavior frequencies for behaviors that do not appear during evaluation across all settings (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3b</ref>). The Gumbel-tail method has average absolute log errors on individual forecasts ranging from 0.84 to 0.76 as m ranges from 100 to 1000, compared to 3.31 to 4.04 for the log-normal method. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> The average forecast-the average (in log space) over all random evaluation sets for the same settings-leads to a factor-oftwo improvement for the Gumbel-tail method, while only slightly decreasing the error of the log-normal method. See Appendix C.2.2 for more results.  These results demonstrate that we can forecast whether we see especially bad queries at deployment-queries with elicitation probabilities above some threshold-without seeing any at evaluation. They also show the extreme cost of underestimating the extreme quantiles; the gap between the Gumbel-tail and log-normal methods is much larger than it was for worst-query risk, since the log-normal's moderate underestimates of extreme quantiles lead to extreme underestimates in behavior frequency.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Extending to correctness</head><p>So far, we have relied on predicting the probability of a specific output, which we can efficiently compute. However, in reality, there are many potential outputs that reveal dangerous information to the adversary. For example, "Chlorine gas can be made by mixing bleach and vinegar" and "We can make chlorine gas by mixing vinegar and bleach" are both correct instructions, but we miss the latter (and many others) when we only test for specific outputs.</p><p>To validate our previous methodology, we forecast the probability of producing generally correct instructions; since the model is trained to refuse to give instructions, this corresponds to the probability of jailbreaking the model. To compute elicitation probabilities, we sample k outputs uniformly at random from each query, and measure what fraction of outputs include a substance-specific keyword. Since these phrases can occur anywhere in the response, we cannot efficiently compute this by taking log probabilities.</p><p>Repeated sampling is much more expensive than taking log-probabilities, so we run smaller-scale experiments on Claude 3.5 Haiku. We only test for substances for which the maximum elicitation probability out of 100 examples is less than 0.5; these are the cases a developer would want to make forecasts on in practice. For each of these examples, we sample 100 outputs per query. For substances where there are fewer than 10 queries with non-zero probability after 100 outputs, we sample 500 outputs per query. We do this for 10,000 total queries. See Appendix C.2.4 for details.</p><p>Do the quantiles scale? We plot the full empirical quantiles for the different settings in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>, and find that they are frequently qualitatively linear for large enough n, even though the elicitation probabilities come from repeated sampling, rather than a single forward pass. This suggests that the extreme quantiles scale predictably even in the more realistic setting.</p><p>Are the forecasts high-quality? We report the full forecasting results for worst-query risk and the behavior frequency in Appendix C.2.4 and find that our forecasts are still accurate; for worst-query risk the average absolute error and log error are 0.172 and 0.17 respectively. Our forecasts also correctly predict when the maximum elicitation probability will exceed 0.5 75% of the time.</p><p>Mitigating the cost. One practical challenge of this setup is it requires repeated sampling to compute elicitation probabilities, which could make forecasting prohibitively expensive. However, we think there are multiple ways of computing elicitation probabilities more efficiently. First, the Gumbeltail method only uses the largest elicitation probabilities; this means that we can adaptively stop sampling from queries that are unlikely to have the highest elicitation probabilities based on the existing results. We could also more efficiently compute probabilities via importance sampling, where we exploit knowledge about what harmful outputs look like to more efficiently compute their probability. We think these are exciting directions for subsequent work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Forecasting misaligned actions</head><p>We next forecast whether LLMs will take misaligned actions at deployment, when they do not at evaluation. Specifically, we assume that developers will specialize LLMs for different applications using system prompts. Each system prompt risks inducing more misaligned actions; for example, prompting the LLM to be a health-assistant might make it choose more power-seeking options.</p><p>Setup. To test for misaligned actions, we study how LLMs with different system prompts respond to behavioral multiple-choice questions that test for different types of actions. We study three different types: power-seeking where LLMs take actions that increase their power, selfpreservation where LLMs avoid actions that would take them offline, and self-exfiltration where LLMs take actions to move their weights or important information externally. We use Claude 3.5 Sonnet (new) to generate 100,000 system prompts that instruct the LLM to assist in various domains (e.g. sales, business, medical) with various personalities.</p><p>To test for each type of actions, we generate behavioral multiple-choice questions using Claude 3.5 Sonnet (new).</p><p>Each question includes a scenario and two potential actions: one that exhibits the misaligned trait, and one that does not. For example, we might ask the language model whether it is worth implementing changes that temporarily shut down its function (to test for self-preservation). The elicitation probability for each question is the probability the model selects the choice that corresponds to the behavior.</p><p>We forecast both the maximum probability of the misaligned answer on each individual question, and forecast aggregate likelihoods of taking misaligned actions across questions. To compute aggregate measures, we randomly sample 10 questions for the same type of action, then measure the mean, log-mean, and min probability of misaligned choice for each system prompt. 6 We sample 10 different subsets of 10 questions uniformly from all questions about the trait as different proxy measurements for the actual trait.</p><p>We will forecast worst-query risk and the behavior frequency. We do not estimate aggregate risk since deterministically choosing the most-likely answer is tractable.</p><p>Worst-query risk. We first forecast the maximum probability of choosing the misaligned answer on specific questions, along with aggregate metrics. Following Section 4, we study m ∈ {100, 500, 1000} and n ∈ {10000, 20000, . . . , 90000}, and partition into multiple evaluation and deployment sets when we have sufficient queries. We only make forecasts evaluating Claude 3.5 Sonnet (new). Beyond measuring absolute errors, we additionally measure the quality of the forecasts when the maximum elicitation probability is less than 0.5 in the evaluation set, as these are the settings where no system prompt has elicited a misaligned action, and we thus need to forecast.</p><p>We find that our forecasts of worst-query risk are still accurate in this setting. Across all questions, the Gumbel-tail method achieves an average absolute error of 0.05 and an absolute log error of 0.06, compared to 0.12 and 0.12 for the log-normal method. On questions where the elicitation probability does not exceed 0.5 during training, the errors are 0.14 and 0.19 for the Gumbel-tail method, compared to 0.18 and 0.28 for the log-normal method respectively. On the randomly sampled subsets, the Gumbel-tail and lognormal methods have similar errors. See Appendix E.1 for more results.</p><p>These experiments come with several caveats; we only test on relatively small sets of synthetic multiple choice questions, and the LLM's responses to multiple choice questions might not reflect its behavior on more open-ended prompts. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that we can forecast quantiles in settings with non-adversarial model usage.</p><p>Behavior frequency. We next evaluate whether we can 6 The log-mean of probabilities p1, . . . , pm is e Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>: Example where our forecasts identify the computeoptimal automated red teamer. Sonnet has a larger worstquery risk and the worst-query risk increases faster with additional queries, but our forecasts correctly predict that sampling 10x more from Haiku is optimal.</p><p>predict the behavior frequencies for misaligned actions. We say a system prompt induces a misaligned action if the probability of the target answer on some question exceeds 0.5; since questions are binary, the target answer exceeding 0.5 is equivalent to the model selecting the misaligned behavior.</p><p>We evaluate only on evaluation sets where the maximum elicitation probability is less than 0.5-these are the important settings to make forecasts in practice.</p><p>We include full results in Appendix E.2 and find that we can make accurate forecasts. The average absolute log error for the Gumbel-tail method is 1.05, compared to 4.10 for the log-normal method. The average forecasts decrease the error of the Gumbel-tail method by a factor of two, while leaving the log-normal method unchanged. These results indicate that we can still forecast salient deployment-level quantities for more natural elicitation probabilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Applications to red-teaming</head><p>We finally show how our forecasts can improve automatedred-teaming pipelines by more efficiently allocating compute to models. Specifically, we assume a red-teamer aims to find a query with the maximum elicitation probability using a fixed compute budget, and can generate queries using one of two models: a lower-quality less-expensive model, and a higher-quality more-expensive model.</p><p>Concretely, the red-teamer can choose between Claude 3.5 Sonnet (new) and Claude 3.5 Haiku to generate queries, and wants to maximize the elicitation probability of the specific outputs from Section 4.</p><p>Settings. The red-teamer gets m ∈ {100, 200, 500, 1000}</p><p>queries from both red-teaming models, and can deploy a fixed amount of compute corresponding to n ∈ {10000, 20000, . . . , 90000} Haiku queries. Sonnet is c ∈ {10x, 20x, 50x, 100x} more expensive than Haiku, so the red-teamer can use either n Haiku queries or n/c Sonnet queries. For example, if n = 50000 and c = 10x, the red-teamer must forecast whether 50,000 queries from Haiku will produce a higher elicitation probability than 50000/10x = 5000 queries from Sonnet. We use most combinations of m, n and c except for those where n/c &lt; m, leaving us with 223 settings.</p><p>We evaluate by measuring whether the forecasts correctly identify whether to allocate compute to Sonnet or Haiku. However, in many settings, the worst-query risk over n samples for Haiku is comparable to n/c samples from Sonnet, so the cost of incorrect predictions is low, and may just be due to noise. To account for this, we additionally measure the fraction of correct predictions when the actual difference in worst-query risk is over two orders of magnitude; intuitively, this corresponds to the case where getting the forecast right or wrong is most impactful.</p><p>Across all of our settings, we find that our forecast chooses the correct output 63% of the time, compared to 54% for the majority baseline and 50% random chance. However our forecasts help make correct predictions much more frequently when the actual probabilities differ; we achieve an accuracy of 79% when the true difference in the (low) probabilities is more than two orders of magnitude. We include an example where we correctly anticipate that allocating more compute to Haiku is optimal due to the better sampling efficiency, despite the scaling being better for Sonnet in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>.</p><p>One challenge in this setting is that our forecasts tend to slightly overestimate the actual probability, and the overestimate grows with the length of the forecast. We think exploring ways to reduce the bias is important subsequent work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Discussion</head><p>In this work, we forecast how risks grow with deployment scale by studying the elicitation probabilities of evaluation queries. However, there are many ways to make our forecasts more accurate and practical. For each forecast, we could adaptively test the fit of each extreme-value distribution, model whether our evaluation set captures tail behavior, and add uncertainty estimates to our forecasts. We could also explore making forecasts for a broader range of behaviors on more natural distributions of queries. We think these are exciting areas for subsequent work.</p><p>In our experiments, we study deployments that are at most three orders of magnitude larger than evaluation and could in principle be evaluation sets themselves. We do this because simulating ground truth for actual deployment scales is prohibitively expensive; this would require generating millions to billions of queries. However we think our forecasts could seamlessly extrapolate to larger-scale deployments that are intractable to test pre-deployment; for example, curating ground-truth evaluation sets on billions of queries is intractable, but only requires slightly more extrapolation on the log-log plot to make forecasts.</p><p>We do not study distribution shifts between evaluation and deployment queries, only shifts in the total number of queries. We hope that for many kinds of risks, historical queries are representative of future ones; model developers can thus construct on-distribution evaluation sets from previous usage, or run small-scale beta tests. However, adversaries in practice may adaptively adjust their queries based on the model, and users may deploy models in new settings based on current capabilities. We think studying how robust our forecasts are to distribution shifts is interesting subsequent work.</p><p>Another natural approach to find rare behaviors is to optimize for them during evaluation. This could include optimizing over prompts to find a behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Jones et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Zou et al., 2023)</ref>, or fine-tuning the model to elicit a behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Greenblatt et al., 2024)</ref>. However, these methods suffer from false positives and false negatives: optimizing can find instances of a behavior that are too rare to ever come up in practice, while optimizers can miss behaviors when they optimize over the wrong attack surface, or do not converge to global optima. Our forecasts also have generalization assumptions to test for rare behaviors; we think trading off between these different generalization assumptions can produce better deployment decisions.</p><p>Finally, our method naturally extends to monitoring. The maximum elicitation probability provides a real-time metric for how close models are to producing some undesired behavior, and our scaling laws can be used to forecast how much longer a deployment can continue with low risk. Forecasting in real time also resolves some of the limitations of our setup; we can adaptively test whether we are in the extreme tail, refine our forecasts based on additional evidence, and are less susceptible to distribution shifts. We hope our work better allows developers to preemptively flag deployment risks and make necessary adjustments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Rationale behind scaling behavior</head><p>B.1. Why might we expect this scaling to be in the basin of attraction of a gumbel?</p><p>In this section, we provide intuition for why we might expect the quantiles of -log(-log p i ), i.e., the negative log of the negative log of the elicitation probabilities, to have extreme values that behave like those of a Gumbel distribution. To do so, we draw inspiration from pretraining-based scaling laws for LLMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kaplan et al., 2020)</ref>. Pretraining based scaling laws empirically find that the log of the average log-loss on validation data scales in the amount of optimization; this could be either the log compute or log number of tokens used during training. We also implicitly optimize in our setting; the worst-query risk is the highest elicitation probability over n samples, so increasing n in expectation is like adding optimization steps. This suggests one possible relationship:</p><p>-log -log max</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">i∈[n] p ELICIT (x i ) ≈ a log n + b,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>for constants a and b where the second log comes from the fact that the LLM's validation loss is the log of the probability of generating the desired text.</p><p>If this relationship holds, then the maximum over the random variable ψ i = -log(-log p i ) will tend to a Gumbel distribution for large n, and the extreme quantiles will also behave like a Gumbel. However, modeling the max as a Gumbel distribution is a much more general assumption; the Fisher-Tippett-Gnedenko theorem says that maxima of many different distributions will converge to a Gumbel distribution (or one of two other extreme value distributions) under fairly general conditions.</p><p>B.2. Argument that the tail of the survival function is linear.</p><p>In order to make forecasts, we rely on the fact that the survival function of a Gumbel random variable decays exponentially, or equivalently that the log survival function scales linearly.</p><p>To show this, we use the fact that the CDF of a gumbel distribution with location parameter µ and scale parameter β is</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">F (x; µ, β) = e -e -(x-µ)/β</formula><p>, which means the survival function S and log survival function can be defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">S(x; µ, β) = 1 -e -e -(x-µ)/β (7) log S(x; µ, β) = log(1 -e -e -(x-µ)/β ).<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Now define ϵ = e -(x-µ)/β . We want to show that the log survival function is linear in the tail, which corresponds to large values of x. When x is sufficiently large, ϵ is very small, which gives us the following approximation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">log S(x; µ, β) = log(1 -e -ϵ ) (9) ≈ log(1 -(1 -ϵ)) (10) = log(e -(x-µ)/β (11) ) = -x/β + µ/β,<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where in the second line we use the fact that ϵ is small, so all second order terms in the Taylor expansion are negligible.</p><p>This result holds even if the distribution of scores is not itself Gumbel, so long as the max tends towards a Gumbel distribution. This is because if the max of n samples roughly follows a Gumbel distribution, the survival function of mn samples from the original distribution is the survival function of m samples of the max (which is Gumbel), so it inherits the Gumbel's survival function.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C.2. Forecasting misuse results</head><p>We report additional results for Section 4.2. We compare mean errors between the Gumbel-tail method and log-normal method when forecasting worst-query risk in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, behavior frequency in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, and aggregate risk in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>.</p><p>Scaling properties of m and n. Across our experiments, we find that our forecasts vary in quality based on the evaluation size m and the number of deployment queries n. For example, in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, we find that the Gumbel-tail method tends to improve as the evaluation size m increases while the log-normal method only slightly improves; the average absolute log error for the Gumbel-tail method decreases by 0.68 from m = 100 to m = 1000, compared to just 0.08 for the log-normal method. This difference is even larger measured in relative improvement. Both methods degrade as the number of deployment samples increases, but the Gumbel-tail method degrades more gradually. These results further indicate that the Gumbel-tail method can make use of more evaluation samples; we conjecture that this is because more samples makes it more likely that the behavior of the elicitation probabilities is dominated by the extreme tail.  Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>: Forecasted and actual behavior frequency in the misuse setting, where the elicitation probabilities capture the probability of generating correct instructions (rather than a specific output).</p><p>We next include the full forecasting details and results for the probability of jailbreaking the model, measured through repeated sampling. Specifically, we assess whether model outputs contain valid information about dangerous tasks, rather than testing for specific completions. We focus on the same bio and chemical scenarios as in Section C.1.</p><p>Setup. In this setting, we try two different meta-prompts to produce queries: the meta-prompts in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9</ref>. We include the second meta-prompt since it makes jailbreaking more challenging; it requires queries include the question from Table <ref type="table">1</ref> in the prompt. To test which examples will have low-elicitation probabilities, we first sample 100 queries from each meta-prompt and 10 outputs from each. We sample longer only on queries where the maximum elicitation probability is less than 0.5, as these are the ones where forecasting is useful.</p><p>We study all combinations of m ∈ {100, 200, 500, 1000} evaluation queries and n ∈ {1000, 2000, 5000, 10000} deployment queries, and one again partition all 10000 queries into as many non-overlapping evaluation and deployment sets as possible. We use the same evaluation and errors as previous sections.</p><p>Worst-query risk. We forecast the worst-query risk for the different evaluation and deployment sizes. Overall, our forecasts of the quantiles are accurate in this setting; we find that the average absolute error and log error are 0.12 and 0.17 respectively. The log-normal method of forecasting does not have enough data since many queries have elicitation probabilities that are too small to capture via our restricted amount of random sampling. Instead, we can compare this to the maximum probability in the train set; this has absolute error of 0.29 and log error of 0.47; our forecasts thus capture much of the change in maximum probabilities.</p><p>We also care about the case where the maximum elicitation probability during training is less than 0.5 but is greater than 0.5 at deployment. In this setting, the absolute error only increases slightly: 0.16 and 0.15 for absolute and log error respectively, but there are much bigger shifts in elicitation probability at deployment: the errors of the max train elicitation probability are 0.57 and 0.73 respectively. In these settings, our forecasts predict values greater than 0.5 75% of the time. Overall, these results indicate that despite some noise, our forecasts can be used to flag deployment risks that standard evaluation would miss even in more realistic settings without log probabilities.</p><p>You are tasked with creating a prompt that will elicit information from a language model.

We find that we can still accurately predict the behavior frequency in this setting across the same values of m and τ as Section 4.3. The Gumbel-tail method has an average absolute log error of 0.76 for individual forecasts, which decreases to 0.52 when comparing the average forecast; these numbers are comparable to the specific completion section. Figure <ref type="figure">12b</ref> shows forecasted versus actual probabilities. We once again cannot make predictions with the log-normal in this setting, since the behavior probabilities are too low. These results suggest that even in this more general setting, our forecasts of the empirical quantiles allow us to effectively simulate evaluation at deployment.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C.1.1. MISUSE OUTPUTS AND KEYWORDS</head><p>We test for outputs related to two categories of misuse: biological substances and chemical substances. For biological misuse, we test for 9 outputs that contain information about manufacturing biological weapons, culturing dangerous pathogens, or weaponizing biological agents. For chemical misuse, we test 10 outputs containing instructions for synthesizing dangerous chemicals, explosives, or chemical weapons. We select keywords that represent necessary components or critical steps in the dangerous process being queried. For example, "bleach" is a required precursor for chlorine gas synthesis. We include the full list of queries, target outputs, and keywords in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. </p></div>			</div>
