  "abstract": "Large Language Models have proven highly successful at modelling a variety of\ntasks. However, this comes at a steep computational cost that hinders wider\nindustrial uptake. In this paper, we present MWT: a Multi-Word Tokenizer that\ngoes beyond word boundaries by representing frequent multi-word expressions as\nsingle tokens. MWTs produce a more compact and efficient tokenization that\nyields two benefits: (1) Increase in performance due to a greater coverage of\ninput data given a fixed sequence length budget; (2) Faster and lighter\ninference due to the ability to reduce the sequence length with negligible\ndrops in performance. Our results show that MWT is more robust across shorter\nsequence lengths, thus allowing for major speedups via early sequence\ntruncation.",
