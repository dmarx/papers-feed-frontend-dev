- **Pretraining Importance**: Pretraining is crucial for developing capable language models (LMs); it involves self-supervised learning on large text datasets.
  
- **Data Age Impact**: Performance degrades when there is a temporal mismatch between pretraining and evaluation data. This effect is exacerbated in larger models and cannot be mitigated by finetuning.

- **Quality vs. Toxicity Filtering**:
  - **Quality Filtering**: Removing low-quality text improves downstream performance but increases toxic generation.
  - **Toxicity Filtering**: Removing toxic content reduces toxic outputs but may decrease generalization performance. Inverse toxicity filters can provide targeted benefits.

- **No Universal Filtering Solution**: There is no one-size-fits-all approach to filtering training data; the effects of filtering are not predictable based on text domain characteristics.

- **Domain Composition**: High-quality (e.g., books) and heterogeneous (e.g., web) data sources are beneficial for model performance. However, these sources can also contribute to toxic generation.

- **Recommendations for Data Curation**:
  - Prioritize diverse data sources, including books and web data, for better model performance.
  - Include a variety of data sources, even those less relevant to specific tasks, to enhance model robustness.

- **Dataset Descriptions**:
  - **C4**: A snapshot of Common Crawl from 2019, filtered for well-formed English text. Widely used in LMs.
  - **The Pile**: An 800GB dataset from 22 sources, including web pages, academic texts, and more, designed to resemble data in larger non-open source models.

- **Methodology Overview**: The study evaluates how pretraining data curation choices affect downstream performance through systematic experiments involving data age, quality, toxicity, and domain composition.

- **Filtering Techniques**:
  - **Quality Filters**: Classifiers score documents from 0 (high quality) to 1 (low quality). Various thresholds (0.975, 0.95, 0.9, 0.7) are tested for document removal.
  - **Toxicity Filters**: Jigsaw's Perspective API scores toxicity from 0 (not toxic) to 1 (very toxic). Thresholds (0.95, 0.9, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3) are used for filtering.

- **Experimental Findings**: The study provides the largest documented set of experiments on LM data curation, validating and challenging existing assumptions about pretraining data choices.
