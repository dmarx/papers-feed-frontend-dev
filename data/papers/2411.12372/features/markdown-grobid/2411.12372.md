# RedPajama: an Open Dataset for Training Large Language Models

## Abstract

## 

Large language models are increasingly becoming a cornerstone technology in artificial intelligence, the sciences, and society as a whole, yet the optimal strategies for dataset composition and filtering remain largely elusive. Many of the top-performing models lack transparency in their dataset curation and model development processes, posing an obstacle to the development of fully open language models. In this paper, we identify three core data-related challenges that must be addressed to advance open-source language models. These include (1) transparency in model development, including the data curation process, (2) access to large quantities of high-quality data, and (3) availability of artifacts and metadata for dataset curation and analysis. To address these challenges, we release RedPajama-V1, an open reproduction of the LLaMA training dataset. In addition, we release RedPajama-V2, a massive web-only dataset consisting of raw, unfiltered text data together with quality signals and metadata. Together, the RedPajama datasets comprise over 100 trillion tokens spanning multiple domains and with their quality signals facilitate the filtering of data, aiming to inspire the development of numerous new datasets. To date, these datasets have already been used in the training of strong language models used in production, such as Snowflake Arctic, Salesforce's XGen and AI2's OLMo. To provide insight into the quality of RedPajama, we present a series of analyses and ablation studies with decoder-only language models with up to 1.6B parameters. Our findings demonstrate how quality signals for web data can be effectively leveraged to curate high-quality subsets of the dataset, underscoring the potential of RedPajama to advance the development of transparent and high-performing language models at scale.

## Introduction

Pretraining data is among the most central building blocks that go into the development of modern large language models (LLMs). However, one of the core challenges this field faces is the general lack of transparency regarding the composition and curation strategy of pretraining data [[8]](#b7). Indeed, with a few notable exceptions [[19,](#b18)[4,](#b3)[2,](#b1)[65]](#b64), the majority of reports documenting state-of-the-art LLMs [[1]](#b0) provide scarce details, if any, on their pretraining datasets. Even open-weights models such as LLaMA [[57,](#b56)[58]](#b57) provide little to no details about their training data, let alone release their datasets. Furthermore, the process of studying and building optimal data compositions, along with developing filtering rules and heuristics, is time-consuming as it necessitates running numerous ablations on   [[36]](#b35), OLMo [[19]](#b18), Snowflake's Arctic [[54]](#b53) and RedPajama-INCITE. SlimPajama is a cleaned and deduplicated version of RedPajama-V1. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we position the RedPajama dataset in the current landscape of open pretraining datasets. Section 3 describes the details of the dataset creation process behind RedPajama-V1, as well as building the RedPajama-INCITE family of models. Section 4 proceeds to RedPajama-V2, our web-only dataset. Next to describing the data processing steps, we present dataset statistics and ablation studies. Finally, we conclude in Section 5.

## Related Work

Numerous efforts have focused on constructing pretraining datasets for large language models. While some of these datasets are curated from a mix of various sources, others are exclusively derived from web data. In the realm of web-only datasets, the C4 dataset [[46]](#b45) was one of the first large-scale web datasets, comprising a 175B token web corpus filtered down from CommonCrawl. C4 still remains a benchmark for web dataset quality. More recently, RefinedWeb [[44]](#b43) and FineWeb [[43]](#b42) have demonstrated that web-only data can yield strong models without the need for compositing multiple domains, and have, similar to our work, also provide ample details on their data curation techniques. In contrast to these datasets, RedPajama-V2 is composed of 100 trillion tokens of raw, mostly unfiltered text. With its more than 40 quality signals for potential filtering, RedPajama-V2 promotes an entirely different approach and aims to set a new standard for future high-quality web datasets, providing a robust foundation for the next generation of high quality web datasets. Of further great relevance are the Gopher rules proposed in [[45]](#b44), which have been central to many of the previously mentioned open pretraining datasets.

Complementing web-only datasets, composite datasets introduce additional domains and enable broader coverage. Most notably, the Pile [[17]](#b16) was one of the first fully open datasets. After the release of LLaMA [[57]](#b56), which used seven individual subsets and multiple domains, we published RedPajama-V1 as an open source replication of the LLaMA recipe, which gained widespread adoption. Building on this, the SlimPajama dataset [[51]](#b50) was derived from RedPajama-V1 by further cleaning and deduplication. Similarly, the Dolma [[52]](#b51) dataset includes other specialized domains, such as cleaned versions of code datasets including The Stack [[25]](#b24), StarcoderData [[31]](#b30) as well as the ArXiv and StackExchange splits of RedPajama-V1. The Zyda [[56]](#b55) dataset goes in a similar vein and further refines open datasets, including the SlimPajama dataset derived from RedPajama-V1. Finally, the ROOTS corpus [[26,](#b25)[27]](#b26) is also among the core open datasets spanning multiple domains and languages. Table [1](#tab_0) shows an overview over these open datasets and makes a comparison where each dataset stands in terms of transparency, versatility and scale.  In our first iteration of the RedPajama datasets, our primary goal was to recreate the training data documented in the LLaMA technical report [[57]](#b56). To this end, we closely follow the descriptions of the original recipes. In this section, we first document our process for recreating the original LLaMA training corpus (Section 3.1). We highlight gaps in the description of the original dataset collection and describe how we choose to resolve those ambiguities. Next, we report on RedPajama-INCITE, a family of models trained on this corpus in collaboration with Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL) (Section 3.2). We find that although the resulting models are performant at the 3B scale, there remains a gap at 7B to the original LLaMA-7B model. We hypothesize that this is partly due to the need to train with the FP16 precision.

In addition, this also suggests the possibility that some salient details that went into the construction of the original LLaMA training corpus may be missing.

## Data Processing Steps

Here we describe our attempt to recreate the training corpus described in the LLaMa technical report [[57]](#b56). The pretraining data of the LLaMA training corpus are drawn from seven datasets: English CommonCrawl, C4, GitHub, Wikipedia, Books (Project Gutenberg and Books3), ArXiv, and Stack Exchange. Each of these datasets are given a short (approximately one-paragraph) description in the LLaMA technical report, and there are some gaps in the dataset descriptions. In this section, we detail our process for recreating each of the individual datasets, highlight the gaps in the descriptions from the LLaMA technical report, and describe our choices in resolving those ambiguities. These steps together resulted in a dataset of approximately 1.2 Trillion tokens. Table [2](#tab_1) summarizes these datasets and the token counts. In Table [10](#tab_0) in the Appendix, we further list all uncertainties encountered during the construction of the dataset.

CommonCrawl. The LLaMA corpus includes five CommonCrawl snapshots from 2017 to 2020, processed using the CCNet pipeline [[61]](#b60). CCNet deduplicates each snapshot in shards and assigns a quality classification to the data in each snapshot. It assigns a "head," "middle," and "tail" classification to each document based on the distribution of the perplexity assigned by a 5-gram Kneser-Ney model trained on Wikipedia. Here we only keep the "head" and "middle" buckets and discard the "tail." In addition, Touvron et. al. [[57]](#b56) use a linear classifier trained on Wikipedia reference articles to filter out low-quality documents. The LLaMA paper does not specify which snapshots were used in the dataset or give details on the classifier.

Wikipedia. The LLaMA corpus uses Wikipedia dumps from June to August 2022 across 20 languages, processing the data to remove hyperlinks, comments, and other formatting boilerplate. For RedPajama-V1, we use the Wikipedia dataset available on Hugging Face Hub using the dump from 2023-03-20. This also preprocesses the data to remove hyperlinks, comments, and other boilerplate.

Gutenberg and Books3. The LLaMA corpus uses book corpora from the Gutenberg Project and Books3 from the Pile. We only use the PG19 subset of Gutenberg and use SimHash to remove near duplicates. We originally included Books3 as well but took it down due to copyright issues.

ArXiv. The LLaMA corpus processes arXiv LaTeX files and removes everything before the first section, comments, inline-expanded definitions and macros, and the bibliography, following [[29]](#b28).

We downloaded arXiv data from Amazon S3 in the "arXiv" requester pays bucket and implemented a similar postprocessing, keeping only LaTeX source files and removing preambles, comments, bibliographies, and expanding macros.

Stack Exchange. The LLaMa corpus includes a dump of Stack Exchange. The data is kept from the 28 largest websites, HTML tags are removed from the text, and answers are sorted by score from highest to lowest. Similarly, we download Stack Exchange from the Internet Archive, keep only the posts from the 28 largest sites, and remove HTML tags. In addition, we group the posts into question-answer pairs and order answers by their scores.

## The RedPajama-INCITE family of LLMs

To evaluate how well RedPajama-V1 matches the original LLaMA corpus, we train a family of LLMs of various sizes in collaboration with the Incite project on the Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Lab. The RedPajama-Incite family of LLMs includes a suite of pretrained and instruction-tuned models at the 3B and 7B model sizes. In this section, we first describe the compute setup of the Summit supercomputer and the implications for the pretraining runs (Section 3.2.1).

We then describe how we evaluate the model and speculate on differences in quality between these models and the LLaMA family (Section 3.2.2).

## Summit Training Setup

In this section, we describe the Summit supercomputer and the engineering and pretraining challenges to training the RedPajama-Incite family of LLMs. Our language models were trained using the Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Lab, a cluster containing 4608 6xV100 nodes running an IBM Power9 architecture. This setup introduced a few challenges in training modern LLMs. In the following, we discuss these challenges and describe how we overcame them.

The IBM Power9 architecture uses a different instruction set than most modern chipsets (i.e., Intel-, Arm-, or Apple-based chips). Modern versions of PyTorch and most of the Python stack they depend on are not pre-compiled to support the Power9 architecture (the latest version officially supported was PyTorch 1.9). To support pretraining with modern libraries, members of our team needed to recompile PyTorch from scratch and build a custom training stack for Summit. Some of these efforts are documented in more detail in the GPT-NeoX technical report [[6]](#b5).

As of this writing, the Summit supercomputer runs on V100 GPUs, which are older than A100 or H100 GPUs typically used to train LLMs. Critically, V100s do not support the bf16 data type, which is necessary for modern stable training recipes for LLMs. Instead, we had to train with fp16 and use loss scaling [[37]](#b36) to allow for stable training runs. We also had to lower the learning rate compared to those reported in the LLaMA training, which may have had an effect on convergence (1.6 • 10 -4 for the 3B model and 1.2 • 10 -4 for the 7B model).

The IBM Power9 architecture had slow interconnect, limiting the number of nodes we could use for each run. We were also unable to use the entire cluster since other projects were running simultaneously on it. We used 512 nodes in parallel (3072 GPUs) to train the 7B and 256 nodes in parallel (1536 GPUs) to train the 3B, with a global batch size of 4M tokens for each model. In scaling experiments, we found that we could not further increase the amount of parallelism without increasing the global batch size, which would hurt convergence.

The 6xV100 nodes introduce challenges for training with tensor and pipeline parallelism. We used 12way pipeline parallelism for the 7B and 6-way for the 3B model, as well as 2-way tensor parallelism for both models.

After accounting for these challenges, we were able to train the 3B model for 800B tokens total and the 7B model for 1.001T tokens total on Summit. We decayed the learning rate linearly following a warmup period, matching those described in the original LLaMA paper.

## Evaluation

Here, we discuss evaluations for the RedPajama-INCITE-3B and 7B models on common benchmarks. The full results and benchmark scores are provided in Appendix C.2. After training RedPajama-Base-INCITE-3B for 800B tokens, it has better few-shot performance (measured in HELM classic [[9]](#b8)), as the average score over 16 core scenarios) and better zero-shot performance (measured using Eleuther AI's LM evaluation harness [[18]](#b17)) compared to other open models of similar size, including the well-regarded GPT-Neo and Pythia-2.8B (trained with 420B and 300B tokens, respectively, on the Pile). On HELM, it outperforms these models by 3-5 points. On a subset of tasks from LMevaluation harness, it outperforms these open models by 2-7 points.

The RedPajama-INCITE-7B-Base model is 1.0 points behind Falcon-7B and 4.1 points behind Llama-7B on HELM-classic. We further break down the tasks and see that they lag behind only on tasks that require using logprobs, which computes the difference between the probabilities of right and wrong answers. However, the model achieves comparable average HELM scores on tasks that directly generate answers and measure quality. Since all benchmarks in the LM harness use logprobs, we see similarly lower results for this benchmark. We hypothesize this was partly due to training with FP16, which does not allow us to use larger learning rates. Furthermore, as illustrated in the previous section, there were sources of uncertainty in the construction of the training dataset which likely resulted in a slightly different dataset than what was used to train the Llama-1 model. We believe that these two factors have led to the slightly lower performance compared to the Llama models.

RedPajama-INCITE-7B-Instruct is an instruction-tuned version of the base model optimized for few-shot performance by training on a diverse collection of NLP tasks from both P3 (BigScience) [[49]](#b48) and Natural Instructions (AI2) [[39]](#b38). The Instruct version shows excellent performance on few-shot tasks, outperforming leading open models of similar sizes, including Llama-7B, Falcon-7B (both base and instruct version), and MPT-7B (both base and instruct version) on HELM by 2-8 points. We provide the detailed evaluation scores in the supplementary material.

## RedPajama-V2

In contrast to the first iteration of the RedPajama dataset, the second iteration focuses exclusively on web data and, in addition to design principles Transparency and Scale, we also put a higher emphasis on Versatility. Specifically, next to the goals of providing a fully transparent and open dataset, the purpose of the corpus is to serve as a foundation for creating high quality subsets. While the goal of transparency is achieved by making the dataset and its artifacts publicly available, and scale is achieved by processing large parts of the Common Crawl corpus, to follow the design principle Versatility, we release RedPajama V2 as a dataset that is enriched with a set of metadata that enables fast and cheap iteration for creating high quality, diverse and large datasets. In this section, we first present the data processing steps used to create the raw text data, give an overview over the quality signals available for each document, and present statistics on the dataset composition. Finally, we present ablation studies on how the quality signals can be used to create successively better datasets.

## Data Processing Steps

RedPajama-V2 is a dataset created by processing web documents provided by the CommonCrawl foundation [3](#foot_2) . As web data is inherently noisy and only available as text embedded in the HTML code, it is necessary to process it to make it suitable for training LLMs. To that end, the raw data used for RedPajama-V2 undergoes a series of basic processing steps, which we explain in more detail.

## Data Acquisition

The Common Crawl Archive is a vast repository of web crawl data that is freely available to the public. The corpus contains crawling results since 2013 and is updated regularly on a (bi-) monthly basis. Next to raw web data in HTML (warc) format, the archive also provides metadata (wat) and plain text data in the wet format. It has been the basis for numerous datasets including C4 [[46]](#b45), RefinedWeb [[44]](#b43), Dolma [[52]](#b51), and FineWeb [[43]](#b42) among others.

To create the RedPajama-V2 dataset, we used the web-extracted text (i.e., .wet files) from all 84 monthly snapshots between 2014 and April 2023 and passed it through the CCNet pipeline [[61]](#b60).

In contrast to RPv1, here we keep all perplexity buckets, and in addition to the English language, we also keep French, German, Italian, and Spanish data. We chose this pipeline due to its light processing, which aligns with our guiding principle of preserving as much information in the raw dataset as possible and allowing downstream model developers to filter the dataset. This processing step produces over 100 billion individual text documents.

## Quality Signals

A central ingredient to state-of-the-art open LLMs like Llama [[57,](#b56)[58]](#b57), Mistral [[22]](#b21), Falcon [[2]](#b1), MPT [[53]](#b52), or the Qwen [[3]](#b2) models is the large amount of high-quality data that these models are trained on. For example, Llama 3 is trained on 15 trillion carefully curated tokens. The most prominent data sources that provide the necessary scale are the crawls made publicly available by CommonCrawl. However, this raw text, which in our case is additionally processed by the CCNet pipeline, is still not ideal for direct use as LLM training data due to artifacts arising from the conversion from HTML to plain text (e.g., parsing errors, and menus), sources of generally low quality, and biases inherent to the distribution of content on the web. To clean such datasets, the literature has proposed a multitude of heuristics to extract high-quality datasets out of large corpora of heterogeneous web data. However, unlike previous datasets that filter out low-quality content, our approach retains the entire raw text corpus, incorporating quality signals as additional metadata. This strategy allows us to use the full spectrum of data, transforming sections typically discarded into informative attributes that enhance our dataset's utility. This enables the creation of other datasets such as C4 as special cases of the RedPajama-V2 dataset. For each document, we provide the quality signals used in C4 [[46]](#b45), Gopher [[45]](#b44), RefinedWeb [[44]](#b43), the Pretrainer's Guide [[34]](#b33) and DSIR [[62]](#b61). These can roughly be categorized into quality signals which measure natural language, the repetiveness of the text, are based on the content of the text, ML-based heuristics, and deduplication. In the following, we explain each of these categories in detail. A comprehensive list with detailed descriptions encompassing all quality signals, as well as histograms is provided in Appendix D.2.

Natural Language. Text documents extracted from websites often have content that does not correspond to natural language, such as JavaScript code, menus, and other boilerplate text. To measure how natural a given text document is, we provide simple heuristic measures such as the fraction of all caps words or letters, the fraction of lines that end with an ellipsis, the fraction of unique words, whether or not a line ends in a terminal punctuation mark, and others.

Repetitiveness. An often observed artifact of web data is repetitive text, which has been linked with uninformative content [[45]](#b44). Repetitious generations are also a known failure mode of language models [[21]](#b20), and removing excessively repetitive content can potentially contribute to alleviating this behavior [[45]](#b44). For each document, we calculate the fraction of characters appearing in the most frequent (word) n-gram for n ∈ {2, 3, 4}. Second, we calculate the fraction of characters appearing in any duplicated n-gram for values of n ∈ {5, . . . , 10}. We ensure not to count characters that appear in overlapping n-grams more than once.

Content-based. Web documents can contain harmful and offensive content, which needs to be addressed. To that end we provide the signals used in C4 and RefinedWeb, namely, (1) the number of sequences of words that are contained in the LDNOOBW blocklist [4](#foot_3) . In addition, we include a flag which indicates whether the domain of the document appears in the UT1 list of blocked urls [5](#foot_4) . While these quality signals focus on NSFW content, we believe other content-based filters such as domains or embedding clusters [[55]](#b54) are also promising directions. In Figure [8](#fig_9) in the Appendix, we show the distribution of topics found via clustering of embeddings.

ML Heuristics. ML-based quality signals revolve around the idea of measuring similarity to a high-quality domain. Here, we use fastText classifiers [[24]](#b23), and the importance weights proposed in [[62]](#b61). While ML filters have been shown to improve the quality of datasets (e.g., [[12,](#b11)[57,](#b56)[11]](#b10)), they have also been reported to lead to biases or underrepresent minorities [[15]](#b14). The fastText classifier signals provided in RPv2 are unigram bag-of-word models trained to distinguish between unfiltered RPv2 data and a high-quality domain. For English data, we use Wikipedia, websites referenced by Wikipedia, books, and the OpenWebText dataset. For non-English data, we only use Wikipedia.

The DSIR weights proposed in [[62]](#b61) estimate the importance of individual samples to a given target domain in a reduced feature space and are based on word unigrams and bigram models. The weights are defined as the log-likelihood ratio between a language model of the target vs. the source domain, where we use the same domains as for the fasttext classifiers.

Deduplication. Removing duplicated training data has been found to improve model perplexity and reduce the amount of memorization while reducing the training data size and the required compute [[28]](#b27). Deduplication is also one of the core building blocks of the most popular datasets [[46,](#b45)[52,](#b51)[44]](#b43). In RPv2, we include MinHash signatures for fuzzy deduplication [[10]](#b9) at different similarity levels, as well as IDs of documents found to be exact duplicates via a Bloom filter [[7]](#b6) with the error rate set to 1%[foot_5](#foot_5) . For this document-level deduplication, we proceed sequentially, starting with the most recent dump (2023-14) and successively iterating over the following dumps until we reach the oldest one (2014-15). An overview over how many documents were flagged as duplicates in this manner, can be seen in Figure [3](#fig_4) in the Appendix.

## Dataset Statistics

RPv2 consists of 113B documents in five different languages: English, German, French, Spanish and Italian. As mentioned previously, the CCNet pipeline partitions the dataset into the tree buckets "head", "middle", and "tail" corresponding to documents with low, medium, and high Wikipedia perplexity. There are 32.8B documents in the head+middle partition and 80B documents in the tail partition. Documents in the tail are typically shorter (850 tokens) than in the head and middle buckets (∼ 1500 tokens). Token counts were estimated based on an i.i.d. sample of 100M documents using the Mistral [[22]](#b21) BPE tokenizer. A detailed overview of token counts for each language and partition is given in Table [3](#tab_2). We provide further statistics on the number of documents before and after deduplication, as well as the distribution of quality signals in the supplementary materials.

## Dataset Ablations

Here we present a series of dataset ablations with the aim of developing a better understanding of how the quality signals introduced in Section 4.1.2 influence the downstream performance of language models trained on data filtered with different heuristics. More specifically, here we ask how do different quality filtering rules affect downstream performance? We strive for a broad evaluation and measure the performance on diverse downstream benchmarks and the language modeling objective on multiple domains.

## Setup

Models. We adopt decoder-only Llama-2 architectures [[58]](#b57) with 468M parameters and 1.6B parameters and 2048 sequence length. Both models have 24 layers, 16 attention heads and the MLP expansion ratio set to 4.0. The 468M has 1024 hidden dimension, while for the 1.6B we use 2048.

For each dataset, we train the 468M model on 100B tokens and the 1.6B model on 350B tokens. We use the AdamW [[14]](#b13) optimizer with the weight decay of 0.1, a maximum learning rate set to 5e-3 and 5e-4 respectively, and a cosine decay schedule with linear warmup during the first 1% of steps.

We use relatively small scales, as this enables us to explore a wider range of filters, showing the breadth of the quality filters available in RedPajama.

Hardware and Training Stack. Due to its ease of setup, use, and high model flops utilization, we use the OLMo framework [7](#foot_6) for distributed training, using FSDP [[66]](#b65) for parallelization across multiple GPUs and nodes. For evaluation, we use the lm-evaluation-harness. We train our models on up to 5 H100 nodes with Infiniband interconnect.

Evaluation Metrics. We strive for broad coverage of benchmarks and domains. At the same time, we are operating at a relatively small scale, where many tasks are too hard to provide a high enough signal to distinguish datasets.

Table [4](#): Benchmarks used in our ablations. The column "Agg. BM-Eval" indicates whether the score is used in the aggregate scores reported in Tables [5](#tab_3) and [6](#tab_4).

After careful consideration, we settled for the choice of benchmarks in Table [4](#). Here we present aggregated scores by (1) computing the average over benchmarks, (2) the normalized average, and (3) the normalized sum of ranks for each data recipe. We chose to include the latter to avoid averaging over scores with different scales. More detailed scores are provided in the supplementary materials. To rank datasets based on the Perplexity of target domains, we follow the approach taken in Dolma [[52]](#b51) and adopt the Paloma [[35]](#b34) and Pile [[17]](#b16) validation sets.

## Results

We start by using the quality signals to implement some of the most widely used filters in the literature.

In addition, we also investigate ML heuristics available in RPv2, which are based on fastText bag of n-gram classifiers [[24]](#b23) and DSIR importance weights [[62]](#b61). We run ablations on two subsets of RPv2, namely on the 2023-14 crawl and on the 9 crawls from 2021-49 to 2023-14, which were deduplicated using MinHash LSH on word 13-grams, with 128 hash functions, 9 bands and 13 rows. For the 1.6B ablations, we filter the full RPv2 dataset, then sample roughly 1T tokens and deduplicate it with the same Minhash hyperparameters.

Filters. We seek to cover a wide range of quality filtering configurations. Rather than optimizing the performance on a particular benchmark, the goal is to show that filtering the RPv2 dataset in different ways can lead to wildly different model performance. We thus experiment with variations of the C4 and Gopher rules and also use the ML-based quality signals in RPv2. We also use a custom configuration custom-rules based on word counts, average line length, Wikipedia Perplexity and the Wikipedia References classifier.

Results. From Table [5](#tab_3), we can draw a series of conclusions on filtering the RedPajama-V2 dataset.

First, we can see that the Gopher rules generally improve performance. In particular we see that fuzzy deduplication and filtering with Gopher has the highest aggregated scores across all RPv2 datasets. In addition, both the average and normalized average benchmark score is only second to RefinedWeb, while the rank-score is higher than for RefinedWeb. The per-benchmark tables 18, 19, and 20 in the Appendix, show that the RPv2 dataset filtered with fuzzy deduplication and Gopher is always in the upper middle (minimum rank score 9 of 19), while RefinedWeb is performing worse on Hellaswag, LAMBADA, Winogrande, MMLU and OpenBookQA. This indicates that filtering RPv2 with the full Gopher rules and fuzzy deduplication (Minhash LSH) creates a dataset that performs well across a wider range of tasks than all other datasets. Second, we can see that the Gopher-natlang filters perform better than the Gopher-repetition filters. Third, in the context of model based filtering, we see no significant difference between using a fasttext classifier and DSIR. Fourth, using only the line-level C4 filters appears to reduce perplexity, but has negligible effect on the aggregated benchmark scores. Finally, we notice that the unfiltered RPv2 2023-14 dataset appears to have the lowest perplexity on the Paloma dataset, while other filtering methods lead to models with higher perplexity. We believe that this can (at least in part) be attributed to the wide range of domains covered by Paloma. In addition, Paloma also contains the RPv1 dataset, which can explain the low Perplexity score obtained by the model trained on RPv1-CC. Table [6](#tab_4) shows further that the model trained on RPv2 filtered with the full Gopher rules outperforms the model trained on RPv2 filtered with only the Gopher-natlang rules, and comes close to the quality of a model trained on the RefinedWeb dataset. In conclusion, this series of ablation studies shows how the quality signals in the RPv2 dataset can be used to successively filter better datasets. In combination with its vast scale of over 100T tokens, we see that this dataset provides a powerful source for creating high-quality web datasets for LLM pretraining.

## Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented the RedPajama datasets. With over 100 Trillion tokens, these are the largest, fully open, and transparent datasets for pretraining language models and have been a central building block for many of the strongest open-source LLMs. Next to documentation accompanying the datasets, we have also shown examples of how RedPajama-V2 can be filtered down to successively higher quality subsets, leading to language models of varying levels of quality on a diverse set of benchmark tasks and outperforming models trained on other large-scale pretraining corpora. While the models are relatively small and enabled us to explore a wider variety of filters, it is also a limitation and further, larger-scale explorations are required. We did not explore a thorough decontamination analysis against common benchmarks or an analysis of personally identifiable information present in the dataset, posing another limitation of this work. By publishing the RedPajama-V2 dataset in raw, unfiltered form, but accompanied by a set of quality signals, we hope that future work will continue to build on RedPajama and provide new innovative ways of filtering, curating, and mixing multiple pretraining corpora.

## B.1.2 RedPajama-V2

The core of the dataset is composed of the text documents, accompanied by the quality annotations, duplicate ids and minhash signatures. For the text documents, the structure largely follows the one defined by CCNet. Specifically, the documents for a given CommonCrawl snapshot are partitioned into 5000 shards, where the filename indicates the shard, language of the document, and the perplexity bucket (partition). The quality annotations, duplicates and minhashes follow the same logic and reflect the filenames of the raw documents.

File Structure. The files containing the raw text documents are organized according to the following pattern:

$documents/<snapshot_id>/$<shard_id>/<lang>_<ppl_bucket>.json.gz where snapshot_id corresponds to any of the crawls included in RPv2, shard_id ranges from 0000 to 4999, lang is any one of en, de, fr, es or it. Finally, ppl_bucket indicates the partitioning according to Wikipedia perplexity and is either head, middle or tail. Similarly, quality signals, duplicate ids and minhashes follow the patterns quality_signals/<snapshot_id>/<shard_id>/<lang>_<ppl_bucket>.signals.json.gz, duplicates/<snapshot_id>/<shard_id>/<lang>_<ppl_bucket>.duplicates.parquet, and minhashes/<snapshot_id>/<shard_id>/<lang>_<ppl_bucket>.minhash.parquet.

Documents Structure. The documents are stored as Gzip-compressed JSONL files and follow the schema { " url " : "..." , " date_download " : "..." , " digest " : "..." , " length " : ... , " nlines " : ... , " source_domain " : "..." , " title " : "..." , " raw_content " : "..." , " cc_segment " : "..." , " original_nlines " : ... , " original_length " : .. , " line_ids " : [ ... ] , " language " : "..." , " language_score " : ... , " perplexity " : ... , " bucket " : "..." } Quality Signals Structure. The quality signals are Gzip-compressed JSONL files and follow the schema { " id " : "..." , " id_int " : ... , " metadata " : { " cc_segment " : "..." , " cc_net_source " : "..." , " url " : "..." , " source_domain " : "..." , " language " : "..." , " snapshot_id " : "..." } , " quality_signals " : { " key " : [ [ start , end , score ] ] } }

The quality_signals field is a dictionary with the name of the quality signal as key and a list of tuples as values. Each tuple consists of the three floats start, end, and score indicating the location where the score in the raw_content string applies. This representation follows the one used in Dolma [[52]](#b51) and allows a single representation to encode quality signals which apply at different levels of granularity of the text (e.g., line-level and document-level).

Duplicate IDs. The ids of duplicated documents are stored as parquet files. Each row in the parquet file corresponds to a document which is duplicated at least once across the entire corpus. We emphasize that this does not include the first occurrence of a document which has subsequent duplicates. In other words, if every document appearing in the list of duplicates is dropped, one member of each cluster of documents remains in the dataset.

Minhashes. The minhash signatures are stored in parquet files and are partitioned into multiple bands and rows, corresponding to different levels of Jaccard similarities in the range {0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0}.

## C RedPajama-V1

Here we provide additional details and results for the RedPajama-V1 dataset.

## C.1 Filtering Heuristics for Code obtained from GitHub

As indicated in the main part of this paper, we filter the raw GitHub dataset by keeping only projects under Apache, BSD and MIT licenses, and additionally apply filtering heuristics similar to the ones used in The Stack dataset [[25]](#b24). Specifically, we apply the following set of heuristics, removing any file with the following properties:

• maximum line length of more than 1000 characters.

• an average line length of more than 100 characters.

• a proportion of alphanumeric characters of less than 0.25.

• a ratio between the number of alphabetical characters and the number of tokens of less than 1.5.

• extension is not in the following set of whitelisted extensions: .asm, .

bat, .cmd, .c, .h, .cs, .cpp, .hpp, .c++, .h++, .cc, .hh, .C, .H, .cmake, .css, .dockerfile, .f90, .f, .f03, .f08, .f77, .f95, .for, .fpp, .go, .hs, .html, .java, .js, .jl, .lua, .md, .markdown, .php, .php3, .php4, .php5, .phps, .phpt, .pl, .pm, .pod, .perl, .ps1, .psd1, .psm1, .py, .rb, .rs, .sql, .scala, .sh, .bash, .command, .zsh, .ts, .tsx, .tex, .vb, Dockerfile, Makefile, .xml, .rst, .m, .smali C.2 Detailed Evaluations for the RedPajama-INCITE LLMs Here we provide detailed benchmark scores for the RedPajama-INCITE 3B and 7B LLMs, trained on the RedPajama-V1 dataset.

## C.3 Detailed Sources of Uncertainties in the Construction of the RedPajama-V1 Dataset

Table [10](#tab_0) shows a detailed overview over different sources of uncertainty that arose during the construction of the RedPajama-V1 dataset. These uncertainties mainly stem from a lack of details on the dataset presented in [[57]](#b56). From this list, it can be seen that it is likely that there is a mismatch Table 7: Results for RedPajama-INCITE-Base-3B-v1 on a subset of lm-evaluation-harness (Zero-Shot) and HELM, compared to models with similar parameter counts. The top-scoring model for each benchmark is highlighted in bold font. Lambada OpenAi (acc) Hellaswag (acc_norm) Winogrande (acc) Piqa (acc) Avg. HELM avg.

We believe this is a significant factor that has contributed to the performance mismatch between RedPajama-INCITE and LLaMA-1.

We use a fasttext classifier with unigram features and use 300k training samples.

What threshold was used to classify a sample as high quality?

We set the threshold to match the token count reported in LLama.

## GitHub Quality filtering heuristics

We remove any file • with a maximum line length of more than 1000 characters.

• with an average line length of more than 100 characters.

• with a proportion of alphanumeric characters of less than 0.25.

• with a ratio between the number of alphabetical characters and the number of tokens of less than 1.5.

• whose extension is not in the following set of whitelisted extensions: .asm, .

.sh, .bash, .command, .zsh, .ts, .tsx, .tex, .vb, Dockerfile, Makefile, .xml, .rst, .m, .smali Wikipedia Which Wikipedia dump was used? We used the most recent at the time of data curation (2023-03-20).

## Books

How were the books deduplicated? We use SimHash to perform near deduplication.

## D RedPajama-V2

In this section we provide additional analyses and statistics of the RedPajama-V2 web dataset, and present detailed results for the ablation models trained on differently filtered subsets.

## D.1 Summary Statistics of our Deduplication Approach

In Figure [3](#fig_4), we see how the number of documents in the head+middle partition develops as a function of the point in time of each crawl. What stands out here is that there is a relatively stable number until 2018 and a significantly smaller number of documents between 2014 and 2016 (up to 10x for, e.g., German). It is also worth noting how the number of unique documents over time develops (dashed line). Specifically, since we ran the deduplication from the newest snapshot to the oldest, one expects an increasingly smaller number of unique documents in the corpus, which can be observed from Figure [3](#fig_4) (note the log-scale). However, it is worth pointing out the sudden drop in unique documents occurring for the crawls between 2014 and 2017. We believe that this can be explained by a different list of seeds used by the CommonCrawl web crawler during that period.

## D.2 Quality Signals

In this section we provide further details and statistics on the quality signals which are part of the RedPajama-V2 dataset.  The set of quality signals can be grouped into such with measure natural language (Table [12](#tab_11)), the repetitiveness of the text (Table [14](#tab_0)), are based on the content of the text (Table [15](#tab_3)), or which are ML-based heuristics (Table [13](#tab_2)). In addition, here we also summarize the quality signals which are computed by the CCNet pipeline in Table [11](#tab_10).

## D.2.2 Histograms

Histograms of the distribution of quality signals are shown in Figures [4,](#fig_5)[5](#fig_6),6 and 7. The statistics are obtained from the 2023-06 snapshot and are computed only for English data.

## D.3 Embedding-based Clustering

To compute clusters based on the semantics of text documents, we randomly sampled 2,000,000 documents from the unfiltered 2021-04 snapshot of the RedPajama-V2 dataset and used the Alibaba-NLP gte-large-en-v1.5 model [[32]](#b31) to compute embeddings on the middle 8,192 tokens of each document. We used Nomic Atlas [[41]](#b40) for clustering and topic modeling analysis. An overview of clusters and associated topics is shown in Figure [8](#fig_9). 6 randomly sampled documents, along with their corresponding cluster topics and a 1000-character substring from each document (starting after a random whitespace character), are shown in Table [16](#tab_4) and Table [17](#tab_0).

McAuliffe revived that language as an amendment to the budget. He also called on the General Assembly to immediately convene a special joint committee that had been created to assess the impact that repealing the ACA would have had on Virginia. The legislature will gather April 5 to consider the governor's amendments and vetoes, but leaders said Monday that McAuliffe's new budget language stands no better chance this time. In a joint statement, the Republican leadership of the House of Delegates said expanding Medicaid would lead to increased costs and eventually blow a hole in the state budget. "The lack of action in Washington has not changed that and in fact, the uncertainty of federal health policy underscores the need to be cautious over the long term," the leaders, including House Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford) and the man selected to replace him as speaker when he retires next year, Del. Kirk Cox (R-Colonial Heights), said via email. "Virginians can barely afford our cu
