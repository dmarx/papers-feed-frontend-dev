- **First-layer features**: Commonly resemble Gabor filters and color blobs; considered general across datasets and tasks.
  
- **Last-layer features**: Highly specific to the dataset and task; output units in softmax layer correspond to specific classes.

- **General vs. Specific**: General features are transferable across tasks, while specific features are tailored to the original task.

- **Transfer Learning**: Involves training a base network on a base dataset and transferring learned features to a target network for a different dataset/task.

- **Quantifying Generality**: Defined as the extent to which features learned on task A can be used for task B; measured by performance on transferred tasks.

- **Experimental Setup**: Utilized pairs of convolutional networks trained on non-overlapping subsets of ImageNet to assess feature transferability.

- **Layer Transfer Experiments**:
  - **Selffer Network (B3B)**: First n layers copied from baseB and frozen; higher layers initialized randomly.
  - **Transfer Network (A3B)**: First n layers copied from baseA and frozen; higher layers initialized randomly and trained on dataset B.

- **Performance Degradation Factors**:
  1. **Specificity of Features**: Higher layer neurons specialize to their original task, reducing transferability.
  2. **Optimization Difficulties**: Co-adapted neurons in neighboring layers complicate effective transfer.

- **Distance Impact on Transferability**: Transferability decreases as the similarity between base and target tasks diminishes; transferring from distant tasks can still outperform random features.

- **Initialization Benefits**: Transferring features from multiple layers can enhance generalization performance, persisting even after fine-tuning.

- **Key Findings**:
  - Performance benefits of transferred features diminish with increasing dissimilarity between tasks.
  - Transferred weights outperform random weights, both when frozen and fine-tuned.

- **Figure Reference**: Figure 1 illustrates the network architecture and transfer learning setup; Figure 2 presents performance results of A/B transfer learning experiments.

- **Caffe Framework**: Experiments conducted using the Caffe framework for reproducibility and comparability.

- **Further Research**: Suggested to explore the nature of feature generality and specificity in more depth, particularly in different architectures and datasets.
