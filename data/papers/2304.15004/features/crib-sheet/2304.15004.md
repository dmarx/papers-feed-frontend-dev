- **Emergent Abilities Definition**: Abilities present in large language models (LLMs) but absent in smaller models; cannot be predicted by performance extrapolation from smaller models.

- **Key Properties of Emergent Abilities**:
  - **Sharpness**: Sudden transition from non-performance to performance at specific scales.
  - **Unpredictability**: Emergence occurs at unforeseeable model scales.

- **Alternative Explanation**: Emergent abilities may be artifacts of metric choice rather than fundamental model behavior changes. Nonlinear/discontinuous metrics can create the illusion of emergent abilities.

- **Mathematical Model**:
  - Per-token cross-entropy loss as a function of model parameters \( N \):
    \[
    L_{CE}(N) = N^{c \alpha}
    \]
  - Probability of selecting the correct token:
    \[
    p(\text{single token correct}) = \exp\left(-L_{CE}(N)\right) = \exp\left(-\frac{N}{c}\alpha\right)
    \]

- **Metric Impact**:
  - **Nonlinear Metric (Accuracy)**: 
    \[
    \text{Accuracy}(N) \approx p_N(\text{single token correct})^L = \exp\left(-\frac{N}{c}\alpha L\right)
    \]
    - Results in sharp, unpredictable performance changes.
  - **Linear Metric (Token Edit Distance)**:
    \[
    \text{Token Edit Distance}(N) \approx L(1 - p_N(\text{single token correct})) = L\left(1 - \exp\left(-\frac{N}{c}\alpha\right)\right)
    \]
    - Yields smooth, continuous performance improvements.

- **Predictions Tested**:
  1. Changing from nonlinear to linear metrics reveals smooth performance improvements.
  2. Increasing test dataset size improves resolution, revealing above-chance performance in smaller models.
  3. Performance predictably decreases with increasing target string length.

- **Meta-Analysis Findings**:
  - Emergent abilities appear predominantly with specific metrics, not across task-model family pairs.
  - Changing metrics from nonlinear/discontinuous to linear/continuous removes emergent abilities.

- **Implications for AI Safety**: Understanding the nature of emergent abilities is crucial for predicting and controlling model behavior, especially regarding undesirable capabilities.

- **Figures and Diagrams**:
  - **Figure 1**: Illustrates sharp and unpredictable performance increases in LLMs.
  - **Figure 2**: Shows the relationship between model parameters and performance under different metrics.

- **Conclusion**: Emergent abilities in LLMs may not be inherent properties but rather artifacts of metric selection, emphasizing the importance of careful metric choice in evaluating model performance.
