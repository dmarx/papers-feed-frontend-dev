- **Objective**: Understand optimal targeting of interventions in networks to change individuals' private returns to investment.
  
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Network Structure**: Mediates strategic spillovers and externalities among players.
  - **Strategic Complements vs. Substitutes**: 
    - Complements: Increasing one agent's action increases neighbors' incentives.
    - Substitutes: Increasing one agent's action decreases neighbors' incentives.

- **Intervention Framework**:
  - **Utilitarian Planner**: Seeks to maximize social welfare under a budget constraint.
  - **Intervention Cost**: Increasing in the magnitude of changes to individual returns.

- **Principal Component Decomposition**:
  - Interventions can be expressed in terms of principal components of the network's interaction matrix.
  - **Properties**:
    - Effects of interventions are proportional to the intervention size, scaled by a network multiplier (eigenvalue).
    - Principal components are orthogonal, allowing separate treatment of effects.

- **Theorem 1**: Characterizes optimal intervention based on similarity to principal components.
  - **Strategic Complements**: Optimal intervention aligns with the first principal component (eigenvector centrality).
  - **Strategic Substitutes**: Optimal intervention aligns with the last principal component.

- **Simple Optimal Interventions**:
  - For large budgets, interventions can be simplified to a single principal component.
  - **Propositions 1 & 2**: 
    - Complements: Proportional to the first principal component.
    - Substitutes: Proportional to the last principal component.
  - **Budget Threshold**: The gap between the top two eigenvalues determines the budget size for simplicity.

- **Nash Equilibrium**:
  - Characterized by the equation: 
    \[
    [I - \beta G] a^* = b
    \]
  - **Assumptions**:
    - Symmetric adjacency matrix \( G \).
    - Spectral radius of \( \beta G < 1 \) ensures unique and stable equilibrium.

- **Utilitarian Social Welfare**:
  - Given by:
    \[
    W(b, G) = \sum_i U_i(a^*, G)
    \]
  - Planner's problem: Maximize \( W(b, G) \) subject to budget constraints.

- **Applications**: 
  - Investment games and local public goods as examples of the model's applicability.

- **Further Research**: 
  - Optimal interventions with incomplete information about agents' returns, focusing on distributional impacts on social welfare.
