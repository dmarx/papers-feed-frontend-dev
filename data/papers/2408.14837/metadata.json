  "abstract": "We present GameNGen, the first game engine powered entirely by a neural model\nthat enables real-time interaction with a complex environment over long\ntrajectories at high quality. GameNGen can interactively simulate the classic\ngame DOOM at over 20 frames per second on a single TPU. Next frame prediction\nachieves a PSNR of 29.4, comparable to lossy JPEG compression. Human raters are\nonly slightly better than random chance at distinguishing short clips of the\ngame from clips of the simulation. GameNGen is trained in two phases: (1) an\nRL-agent learns to play the game and the training sessions are recorded, and\n(2) a diffusion model is trained to produce the next frame, conditioned on the\nsequence of past frames and actions. Conditioning augmentations enable stable\nauto-regressive generation over long trajectories.",
