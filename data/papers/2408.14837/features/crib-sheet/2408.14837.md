- **GameNGen Overview**: First game engine powered entirely by a neural model, enabling real-time interaction with complex environments (e.g., DOOM) at over 20 FPS on a single TPU.

- **Next Frame Prediction Quality**: Achieves PSNR of 29.4, comparable to lossy JPEG compression; human raters struggle to distinguish between game clips and simulation clips.

- **Training Phases**:
  1. **Reinforcement Learning (RL) Agent**: Learns to play the game, recording training sessions.
  2. **Diffusion Model**: Trained to produce the next frame conditioned on past frames and actions.

- **Interactive Environment Definition**: 
  - Latent states \( S \)
  - Observations \( O \)
  - Action set \( A \)
  - Transition probability function \( p(s|a, s') \)

- **Interactive World Simulation Objective**: Minimize \( E(D(o_i^q, o_i^p)) \) where \( o_i^q \) are sampled observations from the simulation and \( o_i^p \) are from the environment.

- **Generative Diffusion Model Training**: 
  - Conditioned on agent trajectories \( T_{agent} \) (actions and observations).
  - Loss function: 
    \[
    L = E_{t, \epsilon, T} \|v(\epsilon, x_0, t) - v_{\theta'}(x_t, t, \{\phi(o_{i<n})\}, \{A_{emb}(a_{i<n})\})\|^2_2
    \]

- **Mitigating Auto-Regressive Drift**: 
  - Use Gaussian noise augmentation during training to prevent error accumulation.
  - Noise level \( \alpha \) sampled uniformly to improve frame quality.

- **Latent Decoder Fine-Tuning**: 
  - Fine-tune the decoder of the latent auto-encoder using MSE loss against target frame pixels to reduce artifacts.

- **Inference Setup**: 
  - Use DDIM sampling with Classifier-Free Guidance for past observations.
  - Minimum latency with 4 denoising steps results in 20 FPS.

- **Agent Training Methodology**: 
  - Utilizes Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a CNN feature network.
  - Agent trained on downscaled frame images (160x120) and in-game map, accessing the last 32 actions.

- **Future Work Directions**: 
  - Explore perceptual loss for further quality improvement.
  - Investigate parallel frame generation techniques to enhance simulation rates.
