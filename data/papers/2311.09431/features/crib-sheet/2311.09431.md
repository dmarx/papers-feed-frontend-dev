- **Key Contribution**: Introduction of Striped Attention, an extension of Ring Attention, to address workload imbalance in causal transformer models.
  
- **Workload Imbalance**: Identified in Ring Attention due to triangular structure of causal attention, leading to inefficient computation where some devices perform unnecessary operations.

- **Striped Attention Mechanism**: 
  - Each device processes a discontiguous subset of tokens uniformly distributed throughout the sequence.
  - This ensures that approximately half of the query/key interactions on each device are masked, optimizing throughput.

- **Performance Improvement**: 
  - Achieved up to **1.45×** end-to-end throughput improvement on A100 GPUs for sequence length of **256k**.
  - Achieved **1.65×** speedup on **16 TPUv4 chips** for sequence lengths of **786k**.

- **Causal Self-Attention Formula**: 
  \[
  CausalAttn(Q, K, V) = Softmax(QK^T + C)V
  \]
  where \( C \) is the causal mask defined as:
  \[
  C_{i,j} = 
  \begin{cases} 
  -\infty & \text{if } i < j \\ 
  0 & \text{if } i \geq j 
  \end{cases}
  \]

- **Ring Attention Overview**: 
  - Distributes attention computation across devices in a ring topology.
  - Shards matrices \( Q, K, V \) into blocks for parallel processing.
  - Each device computes interactions based on its stationary \( Q \) block and the \( K, V \) blocks it receives.

- **Algorithm Structure**: 
  - Pseudocode for Ring Attention includes a function `GetMask(j, k)` to determine the causal mask for query/key interactions.
  
- **Tiling Strategy**: 
  - Blocks are divided into tiles to skip computation of fully masked tiles, enhancing efficiency.
  - Example: For a tile size of \( 512 \times 512 \), if three tiles are fully unmasked, they can be skipped, leading to a potential **33% reduction** in compute.

- **Open Source Release**: Code for Striped Attention is available for public use, facilitating further research in long-context causal transformer models.
