- **Self-Play in Autonomous Driving**: Demonstrates effectiveness of self-play in training robust driving policies without human data.
  
- **GIGAFLOW Simulator**: 
  - Capable of simulating 4.4 billion state transitions per hour on a single 8-GPU node.
  - Trains on 1.6 billion km of driving, equivalent to 9500 years of subjective experience, in under 10 days.
  - Cost-effective at under $5 per million km driven.

- **Policy Architecture**: 
  - Parameterized policy Ï€(a|W, S, A, C) where:
    - W = static world
    - S = own state
    - A = other dynamic agents
    - C = conditioning parameter for behavior modulation.
  - Supports diverse traffic participant behaviors (e.g., passenger vehicles, trucks, cyclists).

- **Robustness Metrics**: 
  - Achieves an average of 17.5 years of continuous driving between incidents in simulation.
  - Outperforms prior state-of-the-art benchmarks (CARLA, nuPlan, Waymo) without training on human data.

- **Training Methodology**: 
  - Utilizes Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a variant of Prioritized Experience Replay to enhance learning efficiency.
  - Filters up to 80% of low-impact samples based on estimated advantage to improve throughput.

- **Behavioral Diversity**: 
  - Agents exhibit a range of driving styles (cautious, aggressive) through randomized reward components.
  - Self-play allows for emergent behaviors in complex traffic scenarios (e.g., zipper merges, roundabouts).

- **Simulation Environment**: 
  - Eight maps with varying lengths (4 to 40 km) and random perturbations for diverse training scenarios.
  - Agents navigate to goal points, requiring long-distance driving and complex route following.

- **Performance Evaluation**: 
  - GIGAFLOW policy evaluated zero-shot on benchmarks, outperforming specialist agents trained on specific datasets.
  
- **Uncertainty Modeling**: 
  - Models uncertainty through noise in state observations and stochastic behaviors of dynamic agents.
  - Agents do not have access to the goals or intentions of other agents, enhancing robustness.

- **Neural Network Design**: 
  - Compact architecture with six million parameters, allowing high inference throughput (7.4 million decisions/second).
  - Deep Sets architecture for permutation invariance across observations.
