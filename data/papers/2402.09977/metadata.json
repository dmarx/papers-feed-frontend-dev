  "title": "Fast Vocabulary Transfer for Language Model Compression",
  "authors": "Leonidas Gee, Andrea Zugarini, Leonardo Rigutini, Paolo Torroni",
  "abstract": "Real-world business applications require a trade-off between language model\nperformance and size. We propose a new method for model compression that relies\non vocabulary transfer. We evaluate the method on various vertical domains and\ndownstream tasks. Our results indicate that vocabulary transfer can be\neffectively used in combination with other compression techniques, yielding a\nsignificant reduction in model size and inference time while marginally\ncompromising on performance.",
