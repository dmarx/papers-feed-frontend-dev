### Detailed Technical Explanations and Justifications for Vocabulary Transfer (VT)

#### Vocabulary Transfer (VT) Overview
The primary motivation behind Vocabulary Transfer (VT) is to adapt large pre-trained language models (LMs) to specific domains by utilizing in-domain tokenizers. This adaptation is crucial because language varies significantly across different domains, and a general-purpose tokenizer may not effectively capture the nuances of specialized vocabulary. By transferring knowledge from a general-purpose vocabulary to a domain-specific one, VT aims to reduce the model size and inference time while maintaining performance. This is particularly important in real-world applications where computational resources are limited, and efficiency is paramount.

#### Key Equations
1. **Embedding Initialization**:
   - For tokens present in both vocabularies:
     \[
     E_{in}(t_i) = E_{gen}(t_i) \quad \text{if } t_i \in V_{in} \cap V_{gen}
     \]
     This equation ensures that tokens common to both vocabularies retain their learned embeddings from the general model, preserving the semantic information and reducing the need for retraining.
   
   - For new tokens:
     \[
     E_{in}(t_i) = \frac{1}{|T_{gen}(t_i)|} \sum_{t_j \in T_{gen}(t_i)} E_{gen}(t_j) \quad \text{if } t_i \in V_{in} \setminus V_{gen}
     \]
     This equation allows for the initialization of embeddings for new tokens by averaging the embeddings of their subword components from the general vocabulary. This approach leverages the existing knowledge of the general model, facilitating a smoother transition to the in-domain model.

#### Fast Vocabulary Transfer (FVT)
FVT simplifies the process of embedding initialization by using a straightforward assignment mechanism. This is a significant improvement over the more complex Vocabulary Initialization with Partial Inheritance (VIPI) method, which requires extensive computation to find minimal partitions. FVT's efficiency is crucial for practical applications where computational resources and time are limited. By streamlining the embedding assignment process, FVT allows for quicker adaptation of LMs to new domains without sacrificing performance.

#### Model Compression Techniques
VT can be effectively combined with other model compression techniques such as Knowledge Distillation (KD), quantization, and pruning. This combination is essential for achieving substantial reductions in model size and inference time. For instance, while VT focuses on vocabulary adaptation, KD helps in transferring knowledge from a larger teacher model to a smaller student model, ensuring that the student retains as much performance as possible. Quantization and pruning further reduce the model size by compressing weights and removing unnecessary parameters, respectively.

#### Knowledge Distillation (KD) Process
The two-step distillation process is designed to ensure that the student model learns effectively from both general and in-domain data:
1. **Distillation on General Domain Data**: The student model is first trained on general domain data to capture broad language patterns.
2. **Distillation on In-Domain Data**: The student is then fine-tuned on in-domain data, allowing it to specialize in the specific vocabulary and context of the target domain.

The use of multiple loss functions (distillation loss, masked language modeling loss, and cosine embedding loss) ensures that the student model learns not only to mimic the teacher's output but also to understand the underlying structure of the language, leading to better performance in downstream tasks.

#### Performance Metrics
The evaluation of FVT is based on several key performance indicators:
- **Quality (F1 Score)**: This metric assesses the model's ability to make accurate predictions, which is crucial for maintaining performance after compression.
- **Model Size Reduction**: A significant reduction in model size is essential for deployment in resource-constrained environments.
- **Inference Speedup**: Achieving a speedup between 1.07x and 1.40x indicates that the model can process inputs more quickly, which is vital for real-time applications.

#### Experimental Setup
The experimental setup is designed to rigorously test the effectiveness of VT across various vocabulary sizes and tasks. By using a pre-trained BERT model and fine-tuning it on different datasets, the researchers can assess how well VT adapts the model to specific domains while maintaining performance.

#### Datasets Used
The choice of datasets (ADE, LEDGAR, CoNLL03) reflects a diverse range of domains, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of VT's effectiveness. Each dataset presents unique challenges and vocabulary characteristics, making them suitable for testing the adaptability of the model.

#### Results Summary
The results indicate that in-domain tokenization significantly reduces the average number of tokens per sequence, leading to improved efficiency. The shift in sequence length distribution demonstrates that VT not only compresses the model but also enhances its ability to process domain-specific language effectively.

#### Conclusion
VT emerges as a powerful method for compressing language models, particularly when combined with other techniques like KD. The approach leads to substantial reductions in model size and inference time while ensuring minimal performance
