# A Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations

## Abstract

## 

This paper presents SimCLR: a simple framework for contrastive learning of visual representations. We simplify recently proposed contrastive selfsupervised learning algorithms without requiring specialized architectures or a memory bank. In order to understand what enables the contrastive prediction tasks to learn useful representations, we systematically study the major components of our framework. We show that (1) composition of data augmentations plays a critical role in defining effective predictive tasks, (2) introducing a learnable nonlinear transformation between the representation and the contrastive loss substantially improves the quality of the learned representations, and (3) contrastive learning benefits from larger batch sizes and more training steps compared to supervised learning. By combining these findings, we are able to considerably outperform previous methods for self-supervised and semi-supervised learning on ImageNet. A linear classifier trained on self-supervised representations learned by Sim-CLR achieves 76.5% top-1 accuracy, which is a 7% relative improvement over previous state-ofthe-art, matching the performance of a supervised ResNet-50. When fine-tuned on only 1% of the labels, we achieve 85.8% top-5 accuracy, outperforming AlexNet with 100× fewer labels. 1

## Introduction

Learning effective visual representations without human supervision is a long-standing problem. Most mainstream approaches fall into one of two classes: generative or discriminative. Generative approaches learn to generate or otherwise model pixels in the input space [(Hinton et al., 2006;](#b25)[Kingma & Welling, 2013;](#b30)[Goodfellow et al., 2014)](#b19).

1 Code available at [https://github.com/google-research/simclr](https://github.com/google-research/simclr). However, pixel-level generation is computationally expensive and may not be necessary for representation learning. Discriminative approaches learn representations using objective functions similar to those used for supervised learning, but train networks to perform pretext tasks where both the inputs and labels are derived from an unlabeled dataset. Many such approaches have relied on heuristics to design pretext tasks [(Doersch et al., 2015;](#b12)[Zhang et al., 2016;](#b59)[Noroozi & Favaro, 2016;](#b42)[Gidaris et al., 2018)](#b18), which could limit the generality of the learned representations. Discriminative approaches based on contrastive learning in the latent space have recently shown great promise, achieving state-of-theart results [(Hadsell et al., 2006;](#b21)[Dosovitskiy et al., 2014;](#b15)[Oord et al., 2018;](#b43)[Bachman et al., 2019)](#b1).

In this work, we introduce a simple framework for contrastive learning of visual representations, which we call SimCLR. Not only does SimCLR outperform previous work (Figure [1](#fig_0)), but it is also simpler, requiring neither specialized architectures [(Bachman et al., 2019;](#b1)[Hénaff et al., 2019)](#b24) nor a memory bank [(Wu et al., 2018;](#b53)[Tian et al., 2019;](#b51)[He et al., 2019;](#b23)[Misra & van der Maaten, 2019)](#b40).

In order to understand what enables good contrastive representation learning, we systematically study the major components of our framework and show that:

$arXiv:2002.05709v3 [cs.$LG] 1 Jul 2020

• Composition of multiple data augmentation operations is crucial in defining the contrastive prediction tasks that yield effective representations. In addition, unsupervised contrastive learning benefits from stronger data augmentation than supervised learning.

• Introducing a learnable nonlinear transformation between the representation and the contrastive loss substantially improves the quality of the learned representations.

• Representation learning with contrastive cross entropy loss benefits from normalized embeddings and an appropriately adjusted temperature parameter.

• Contrastive learning benefits from larger batch sizes and longer training compared to its supervised counterpart. Like supervised learning, contrastive learning benefits from deeper and wider networks.

We combine these findings to achieve a new state-of-the-art in self-supervised and semi-supervised learning on Ima-geNet ILSVRC-2012 [(Russakovsky et al., 2015)](#b45). Under the linear evaluation protocol, SimCLR achieves 76.5% top-1 accuracy, which is a 7% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art [(Hénaff et al., 2019)](#b24). When fine-tuned with only 1% of the ImageNet labels, SimCLR achieves 85.8% top-5 accuracy, a relative improvement of 10% [(Hénaff et al., 2019)](#b24). When fine-tuned on other natural image classification datasets, SimCLR performs on par with or better than a strong supervised baseline [(Kornblith et al., 2019)](#b32) on 10 out of 12 datasets.

## Method

## The Contrastive Learning Framework

Inspired by recent contrastive learning algorithms (see Section 7 for an overview), SimCLR learns representations by maximizing agreement between differently augmented views of the same data example via a contrastive loss in the latent space. As illustrated in Figure [2](#fig_13), this framework comprises the following four major components.

• A stochastic data augmentation module that transforms any given data example randomly resulting in two correlated views of the same example, denoted xi and xj , which we consider as a positive pair. In this work, we sequentially apply three simple augmentations: random cropping followed by resize back to the original size, random color distortions, and random Gaussian blur. As shown in Section 3, the combination of random crop and color distortion is crucial to achieve a good performance.

• A neural network base encoder f (•) that extracts representation vectors from augmented data examples. Our framework allows various choices of the network architecture without any constraints. We opt for simplicity and adopt the commonly used ResNet [(He et al., 2016](#b22))

$←-Representation -→ x xi xj hi hj zi zj t ∼ T t ∼ T f (•) f (•) g(•) g(•)$Maximize agreement

Figure [2](#fig_13). A simple framework for contrastive learning of visual representations. Two separate data augmentation operators are sampled from the same family of augmentations (t ∼ T and t ∼ T ) and applied to each data example to obtain two correlated views. A base encoder network f (•) and a projection head g(•) are trained to maximize agreement using a contrastive loss. After training is completed, we throw away the projection head g(•) and use encoder f (•) and representation h for downstream tasks.

to obtain

$h i = f ( xi ) = ResNet( xi )$where h i ∈ R d is the output after the average pooling layer.

• A small neural network projection head g(•) that maps representations to the space where contrastive loss is applied. We use a MLP with one hidden layer to obtain

$z i = g(h i ) = W (2) σ(W (1) h i )$where σ is a ReLU nonlinearity. As shown in section 4, we find it beneficial to define the contrastive loss on z i 's rather than h i 's.

• A contrastive loss function defined for a contrastive prediction task. Given a set { xk } including a positive pair of examples xi and xj , the contrastive prediction task aims to identify xj in { xk } k =i for a given xi . We randomly sample a minibatch of N examples and define the contrastive prediction task on pairs of augmented examples derived from the minibatch, resulting in 2N data points. We do not sample negative examples explicitly. Instead, given a positive pair, similar to (Chen et al., 2017), we treat the other 2(N -1) augmented examples within a minibatch as negative examples. Let sim(u, v) = u v/ u v denote the dot product between 2 normalized u and v (i.e. cosine similarity). Then the loss function for a positive pair of examples (i, j) is defined as

$i,j = -log exp(sim(z i , z j )/τ ) 2N k=1 1 [k =i] exp(sim(z i , z k )/τ ) ,(1)$where 1 [k =i] ∈ {0, 1} is an indicator function evaluating to 1 iff k = i and τ denotes a temperature parameter. The final loss is computed across all positive pairs, both (i, j) and (j, i), in a mini-batch. This loss has been used in previous work [(Sohn, 2016;](#b48)[Wu et al., 2018;](#b53)[Oord et al., 2018)](#b43); for convenience, we term it NT-Xent (the normalized temperature-scaled cross entropy loss).

Algorithm 1 summarizes the proposed method.

## Training with Large Batch Size

To keep it simple, we do not train the model with a memory bank [(Wu et al., 2018;](#b53)[He et al., 2019)](#b23). Instead, we vary the training batch size N from 256 to 8192. A batch size of 8192 gives us 16382 negative examples per positive pair from both augmentation views. Training with large batch size may be unstable when using standard SGD/Momentum with linear learning rate scaling [(Goyal et al., 2017)](#b20). To stabilize the training, we use the LARS optimizer [(You et al., 2017)](#b57) for all batch sizes. We train our model with Cloud TPUs, using 32 to 128 cores depending on the batch size. 2   Global BN. Standard ResNets use batch normalization [(Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015)](#b28). In distributed training with data parallelism, the BN mean and variance are typically aggregated locally per device. In our contrastive learning, as positive pairs are computed in the same device, the model can exploit the local information leakage to improve prediction accuracy without improving representations. We address this issue by aggregating BN mean and variance over all devices during the training. Other approaches include shuffling data examples across devices [(He et al., 2019)](#b23), or replacing BN with layer norm [(Hénaff et al., 2019)](#b24).

2 With 128 TPU v3 cores, it takes ∼1.5 hours to train our ResNet-50 with a batch size of 4096 for 100 epochs.   

## Evaluation Protocol

Here we lay out the protocol for our empirical studies, which aim to understand different design choices in our framework.

Dataset and Metrics. Most of our study for unsupervised pretraining (learning encoder network f without labels) is done using the ImageNet ILSVRC-2012 dataset [(Russakovsky et al., 2015)](#b45). Some additional pretraining experiments on [CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009)](#) can be found in Appendix B.9. We also test the pretrained results on a wide range of datasets for transfer learning. To evaluate the learned representations, we follow the widely used linear evaluation protocol [(Zhang et al., 2016;](#b59)[Oord et al., 2018;](#b43)[Bachman et al., 2019;](#b1)[Kolesnikov et al., 2019)](#b31), where a linear classifier is trained on top of the frozen base network, and test accuracy is used as a proxy for representation quality. Beyond linear evaluation, we also compare against state-of-the-art on semi-supervised and transfer learning.

Default setting. Unless otherwise specified, for data augmentation we use random crop and resize (with random flip), color distortions, and Gaussian blur (for details, see Appendix A). We use ResNet-50 as the base encoder network, and a 2-layer MLP projection head to project the representation to a 128-dimensional latent space. As the loss, we use NT-Xent, optimized using LARS with learning rate of 4.8 (= 0.3 × BatchSize/256) and weight decay of 10 -6 . We train at batch size 4096 for 100 epochs. [3](#foot_0) Furthermore, we use linear warmup for the first 10 epochs, and decay the learning rate with the cosine decay schedule without restarts [(Loshchilov & Hutter, 2016)](#b36).

## Data Augmentation for Contrastive Representation Learning

Data augmentation defines predictive tasks. While data augmentation has been widely used in both supervised and unsupervised representation learning (Krizhevsky et al.,  [2019](#)) achieve neighboring view prediction via a fixed image splitting procedure and a context aggregation network. We show that this complexity can be avoided by performing simple random cropping (with resizing) of target images, which creates a family of predictive tasks subsuming the above mentioned two, as shown in Figure [3](#fig_3). This simple design choice conveniently decouples the predictive task from other components such as the neural network architecture. Broader contrastive prediction tasks can be defined by extending the family of augmentations and composing them stochastically.

## Composition of data augmentation operations is crucial for learning good representations

To systematically study the impact of data augmentation, we consider several common augmentations here. One type of augmentation involves spatial/geometric transformation of data, such as cropping and resizing (with horizontal flipping), rotation [(Gidaris et al., 2018)](#b18) and cutout [(De-Vries & Taylor, 2017)](#). The other type of augmentation involves appearance transformation, such as color distortion (including color dropping, brightness, contrast, saturation, hue) [(Howard, 2013;](#b27)[Szegedy et al., 2015)](#b50), Gaussian blur, and Sobel filtering. Figure [4](#fig_4) visualizes the augmentations that we study in this work. Crop Cutout Color Sobel Noise Blur Rotate 1st transformation 33.1 33.9 56.3 46.0 39.9 35.0 30.2 39.2 32.2 25.6 33.9 40.0 26.5 25.2 22.4 29.4 55.8 35.5 18.8 21.0 11.4 16.5 20.8 25.7 46.2 40.6 20.9 4.0 9.3 6.2 4.2 18.8 38.8 25.8 7.5 7.6 9.8 9.8 9.6 15.5 35.1 25.2 16.6 5.8 9.7 2.6 6.7 14.5 30.0 22.5 20.7 4.3 9.7 6.5 2.6 13.8

Figure [5](#). Linear evaluation (ImageNet top-1 accuracy) under individual or composition of data augmentations, applied only to one branch. For all columns but the last, diagonal entries correspond to single transformation, and off-diagonals correspond to composition of two transformations (applied sequentially). The last column reflects the average over the row.

To understand the effects of individual data augmentations and the importance of augmentation composition, we investigate the performance of our framework when applying augmentations individually or in pairs. Since ImageNet images are of different sizes, we always apply crop and resize images [(Krizhevsky et al., 2012;](#b35)[Szegedy et al., 2015)](#b50), which makes it difficult to study other augmentations in the absence of cropping. To eliminate this confound, we consider an asymmetric data transformation setting for this ablation. Specifically, we always first randomly crop images and resize them to the same resolution, and we then apply the targeted transformation(s) only to one branch of the framework in Figure [2](#fig_13), while leaving the other branch as the identity (i.e. t(x i ) = x i ). Note that this asymmet-   ric data augmentation hurts the performance. Nonetheless, this setup should not substantively change the impact of individual data augmentations or their compositions.

Figure [5](#) shows linear evaluation results under individual and composition of transformations. We observe that no single transformation suffices to learn good representations, even though the model can almost perfectly identify the positive pairs in the contrastive task. When composing augmentations, the contrastive prediction task becomes harder, but the quality of representation improves dramatically. Appendix B.2 provides a further study on composing broader set of augmentations.

One composition of augmentations stands out: random cropping and random color distortion. We conjecture that one serious issue when using only random cropping as data augmentation is that most patches from an image share a similar color distribution. Figure [6](#fig_7) shows that color histograms alone suffice to distinguish images. Neural nets may exploit this shortcut to solve the predictive task. Therefore, it is critical to compose cropping with color distortion in order to learn generalizable features.

## Contrastive learning needs stronger data augmentation than supervised learning

To further demonstrate the importance of the color augmentation, we adjust the strength of color augmentation as Models in blue dots are ours trained for 100 epochs, models in red stars are ours trained for 1000 epochs, and models in green crosses are supervised ResNets trained for 90 epochs[foot_2](#foot_2)[(He et al., 2016)](#b22).

shown in Table [1](#tab_2). Stronger color augmentation substantially improves the linear evaluation of the learned unsupervised models. In this context, AutoAugment [(Cubuk et al., 2019)](#b9), a sophisticated augmentation policy found using supervised learning, does not work better than simple cropping + (stronger) color distortion. When training supervised models with the same set of augmentations, we observe that stronger color augmentation does not improve or even hurts their performance. Thus, our experiments show that unsupervised contrastive learning benefits from stronger (color) data augmentation than supervised learning. Although previous work has reported that data augmentation is useful for self-supervised learning [(Doersch et al., 2015;](#b12)[Bachman et al., 2019;](#b1)[Hénaff et al., 2019;](#b24)[Asano et al., 2019)](#b0), we show that data augmentation that does not yield accuracy benefits for supervised learning can still help considerably with contrastive learning.

## Architectures for Encoder and Head

4.1. Unsupervised contrastive learning benefits (more) from bigger models

Figure [7](#fig_8) shows, perhaps unsurprisingly, that increasing depth and width both improve performance. While similar findings hold for supervised learning [(He et al., 2016)](#b22), we find the gap between supervised models and linear classifiers trained on unsupervised models shrinks as the model size increases, suggesting that unsupervised learning benefits more from bigger models than its supervised counterpart.

All input vectors, i.e. u, v + , v -, are 2 normalized. NT-Xent is an abbreviation for "Normalized Temperature-scaled Cross Entropy". Different loss functions impose different weightings of positive and negative examples. 

## A nonlinear projection head improves the representation quality of the layer before it

We then study the importance of including a projection head, i.e. g(h). Figure [8](#fig_9) shows linear evaluation results using three different architecture for the head: (1) identity mapping;

(2) linear projection, as used by several previous approaches [(Wu et al., 2018)](#b53); and (3) the default nonlinear projection with one additional hidden layer (and ReLU activation), similar to [Bachman et al. (2019)](#b1). We observe that a nonlinear projection is better than a linear projection (+3%), and much better than no projection (>10%). When a projection head is used, similar results are observed regardless of output dimension. Furthermore, even when nonlinear projection is used, the layer before the projection head, h, is still much better (>10%) than the layer after, z = g(h), which shows that the hidden layer before the projection head is a better representation than the layer after.

We conjecture that the importance of using the representation before the nonlinear projection is due to loss of information induced by the contrastive loss. In particular, z = g(h) is trained to be invariant to data transformation. Thus, g can remove information that may be useful for the downstream task, such as the color or orientation of objects. By leveraging the nonlinear transformation g(•), more information can be formed and maintained in h. To verify this hypothesis, we conduct experiments that use either h or g(h) to learn to predict the transformation applied during the pretraining.

Here we set g(h) = W (2) σ(W (1) h), with the same input and output dimensionality (i.e. 2048). be found in Appendix B.4.

## Loss Functions and Batch Size

5.1. Normalized cross entropy loss with adjustable temperature works better than alternatives

We compare the NT-Xent loss against other commonly used contrastive loss functions, such as logistic loss [(Mikolov et al., 2013)](#b39), and margin loss [(Schroff et al., 2015)](#b46). Table [2](#) shows the objective function as well as the gradient to the input of the loss function. Looking at the gradient, we observe 1) 2 normalization (i.e. cosine similarity) along with temperature effectively weights different examples, and an appropriate temperature can help the model learn from hard negatives; and 2) unlike cross-entropy, other objective functions do not weigh the negatives by their relative hardness. As a result, one must apply semi-hard negative mining [(Schroff et al., 2015)](#b46) for these loss functions: instead of computing the gradient over all loss terms, one can compute the gradient using semi-hard negative terms (i.e., those that are within the loss margin and closest in distance, but farther than positive examples).

To make the comparisons fair, we use the same 2 normalization for all loss functions, and we tune the hyperparameters, and report their best results. [8](#foot_3) Table [4](#tab_5) shows that, while (semi-hard) negative mining helps, the best result is still much worse than our default NT-Xent loss.

Margin NT-Logi. Margin (sh) NT-Logi.(sh) NT-Xent 50.9 51.6 57.5 57.9 63.9 Table 5. Linear evaluation for models trained with different choices of 2 norm and temperature τ for NT-Xent loss. The contrastive distribution is over 4096 examples. We next test the importance of the 2 normalization (i.e. cosine similarity vs dot product) and temperature τ in our default NT-Xent loss. Table [5](#) shows that without normalization and proper temperature scaling, performance is significantly worse. Without 2 normalization, the contrastive task accuracy is higher, but the resulting representation is worse under linear evaluation.

## Contrastive learning benefits (more) from larger batch sizes and longer training

Figure [9](#fig_10) shows the impact of batch size when models are trained for different numbers of epochs. We find that, when the number of training epochs is small (e.g.  11 The details of sampling and exact subsets can be found in [https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/imagenet2012_subset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/imagenet2012_subset).

## Related Work

The idea of making representations of an image agree with each other under small transformations dates back to [Becker & Hinton (1992)](#b2). We extend it by leveraging recent advances in data augmentation, network architecture and contrastive loss. A similar consistency idea, but for class label prediction, has been explored in other contexts such as semisupervised learning [(Xie et al., 2019;](#b55)[Berthelot et al., 2019)](#b4).

Handcrafted pretext tasks. The recent renaissance of selfsupervised learning began with artificially designed pretext tasks, such as relative patch prediction [(Doersch et al., 2015)](#b12), solving jigsaw puzzles [(Noroozi & Favaro, 2016)](#b42), colorization [(Zhang et al., 2016)](#b59) and rotation prediction [(Gidaris et al., 2018;](#b18)[Chen et al., 2019)](#b7). Although good results can be obtained with bigger networks and longer training [(Kolesnikov et al., 2019)](#b31), these pretext tasks rely on somewhat ad-hoc heuristics, which limits the generality of learned representations.

Contrastive visual representation learning. Dating back to [Hadsell et al. (2006)](#b21), these approaches learn representations by contrasting positive pairs against negative pairs. Along these lines, [Dosovitskiy et al. (2014)](#b15) proposes to treat each instance as a class represented by a feature vector (in a parametric form). [Wu et al. (2018)](#b53) proposes to use a memory bank to store the instance class representation vector, an approach adopted and extended in several recent papers [(Zhuang et al., 2019;](#b60)[Tian et al., 2019;](#b51)[He et al., 2019;](#b23)[Misra & van der Maaten, 2019)](#b40). Other work explores the use of in-batch samples for negative sampling instead of a memory bank [(Doersch & Zisserman, 2017;](#b11)[Ye et al., 2019;](#b56)[Ji et al., 2019)](#b29).

Recent literature has attempted to relate the success of their methods to maximization of mutual information between latent representations [(Oord et al., 2018;](#b43)[Hénaff et al., 2019;](#b24)[Hjelm et al., 2018;](#b26)[Bachman et al., 2019)](#b1). However, it is not clear if the success of contrastive approaches is determined by the mutual information, or by the specific form of the contrastive loss [(Tschannen et al., 2019)](#b52).

We note that almost all individual components of our framework have appeared in previous work, although the specific instantiations may be different. The superiority of our framework relative to previous work is not explained by any single design choice, but by their composition. We provide a comprehensive comparison of our design choices with those of previous work in Appendix C.

## Conclusion

In this work, we present a simple framework and its instantiation for contrastive visual representation learning. We carefully study its components, and show the effects of different design choices. By combining our findings, we improve considerably over previous methods for selfsupervised, semi-supervised, and transfer learning.

Our approach differs from standard supervised learning on ImageNet only in the choice of data augmentation, the use of a nonlinear head at the end of the network, and the loss function. The strength of this simple framework suggests that, despite a recent surge in interest, self-supervised learning remains undervalued.

## A. Data Augmentation Details

In our default pretraining setting (which is used to train our best models), we utilize random crop (with resize and random flip), random color distortion, and random Gaussian blur as the data augmentations. The details of these three augmentations are provided below.

## Random crop and resize to 224x224

We use standard Inception-style random cropping [(Szegedy et al., 2015)](#b50). The crop of random size (uniform from 0.08 to 1.0 in area) of the original size and a random aspect ratio (default: of 3/4 to 4/3) of the original aspect ratio is made. This crop is finally resized to the original size. This has been implemented in Tensorflow as "slim.preprocessing.inception_preprocessing.distorted_bounding_box_crop", or in Pytorch as "torchvision.transforms.RandomResizedCrop". Additionally, the random crop (with resize) is always followed by a random horizontal/left-to-right flip with 50% probability. This is helpful but not essential. By removing this from our default augmentation policy, the top-1 linear evaluation drops from 64.5% to 63.4% for our ResNet-50 model trained in 100 epochs.

Color distortion Color distortion is composed by color jittering and color dropping. We find stronger color jittering usually helps, so we set a strength parameter.

A pseudo-code for color distortion using TensorFlow is as follows.

import tensorflow as tf def color_distortion(image, s=1.0): # image is a tensor with value range in [0, 1]. # s is the strength of color distortion. def color_jitter(x): # one can also shuffle the order of following augmentations # each time they are applied. x = tf.image.random_brightness(x, max_delta=0.8 * s) x = tf.image.random_contrast(x, lower=1-0.8 * s, upper=1+0.8 * s) x = tf.image.random_saturation(x, lower=1-0.8 * s, upper=1+0.8 * s) x = tf.image.random_hue(x, max_delta=0.2 * s) x = tf.clip_by_value(x, 0, 1) return x def color_drop(x): image = tf.image.rgb_to_grayscale(image) image = tf.tile(image, [1, 1, 3]) # randomly apply transformation with probability p. image = random_apply(color_jitter, image, p=0.8) image = random_apply(color_drop, image, p=0.2) return image A pseudo-code for color distortion using Pytorch is as follows 12 . from torchvision import transforms def get_color_distortion(s=1.0): # s is the strength of color distortion. color_jitter = transforms.ColorJitter(0.8 * s, 0.8 * s, 0.8 * s, 0.2 * s) rnd_color_jitter = transforms.RandomApply([color_jitter], p=0.8) rnd_gray = transforms.RandomGrayscale(p=0.2) color_distort = transforms.Compose([ rnd_color_jitter, rnd_gray]) return color_distort

Gaussian blur This augmentation is in our default policy. We find it helpful, as it improves our ResNet-50 trained for 100 epochs from 63.2% to 64.5%. We blur the image 50% of the time using a Gaussian kernel. We randomly sample σ ∈ [0.1, 2.0], and the kernel size is set to be 10% of the image height/width. In both Figure [9](#fig_10) and [Figure B](#).1, we use a linear scaling of learning rate similar to [(Goyal et al., 2017)](#b20) when training with different batch sizes. Although linear learning rate scaling is popular with SGD/Momentum optimizer, we find a square root learning rate scaling is more desirable with LARS optimizer. With square root learning rate scaling, we have LearningRate = 0.075 × √ BatchSize, instead of LearningRate = 0.3 × BatchSize/256 in the linear scaling case, but the learning rate is the same under both scaling methods when batch size of 4096 (our default batch size). A comparison is presented in Table [B](#).1, where we observe that square root learning rate scaling improves the performance for models trained with small batch sizes and in smaller number of epochs.

On the left side of slash sign are models trained with linear LR scaling, and on the right are models trained with square root LR scaling. The result is bolded if it is more than 0.5% better. Square root LR scaling works better for smaller batch size trained in fewer epochs (with LARS optimizer).

We also train with larger batch size (up to 32K) and longer (up to 3200 epochs), with the square root learning rate scaling. A shown in Figure [B](#).2, the performance seems to saturate with a batch size of 8192, while training longer can still significantly improve the performance.  

## B.2. Broader composition of data augmentations further improves performance

Our best results in the main text (Table [6](#tab_7) and [7](#tab_8)) can be further improved when expanding the default augmentation policy to include the following: (1) Sobel filtering, (2) additional color distortion (equalize, solarize), and (3) motion blur. For linear evaluation protocol, the ResNet-50 models (1×, 2×, 4×) trained with broader data augmentations achieve 70.0 (+0.7), 74.4 (+0.2), 76.8 (+0.3), respectively.

Table B.2 shows ImageNet accuracy obtained by fine-tuning the SimCLR model (see Appendix B.5 for the details of fine-tuning procedure). Interestingly, when fine-tuned on full (100%) ImageNet training set, our ResNet (4×) model achieves 80.4% top-1 / 95.4% top-5[foot_4](#foot_4) , which is significantly better than that (78.4% top-1 / 94.2% top-5) of training from scratch using the same set of augmentations (i.e. random crop and horizontal flip). For ResNet-50 (2×), fine-tuning our pre-trained ResNet-50 (2×) is also better than training from scratch (77.8% top-1 / 93.9% top-5). There is no improvement from fine-tuning for ResNet-50.

Effects of Longer Training for Supervised Models Here we perform experiments to see how training steps and stronger data augmentation affect supervised training. We test ResNet-50 and ResNet-50 (4×) under the same set of data augmentations (random crops, color distortion, 50% Gaussian blur) as used in our unsupervised models. Figure B.3 shows the top-1 accuracy. We observe that there is no significant benefit from training supervised models longer on ImageNet. Stronger data augmentation slightly improves the accuracy of ResNet-50 (4×) but does not help on ResNet-50. When stronger data augmentation is applied, ResNet-50 generally requires longer training (e.g. 500 epochs 14 ) to obtain the optimal result, while ResNet-50 (4×) does not benefit from longer training.

Only random cropping (with random left-to-right flipping and resizing to 224x224) is used for preprocessing. We do not use any regularization (including weight decay). For 1% labeled data we fine-tune for 60 epochs, and for 10% labeled data we fine-tune for 30 epochs. For the inference, we resize the given image to 256x256, and take a single center crop of 224x224.

## B.6. Linear Evaluation

For linear evaluation, we follow similar procedure as fine-tuning (described in Appendix B.5), except that a larger learning rate of 1.6 (following LearningRate = 0.1 × BatchSize/256) and longer training of 90 epochs. Alternatively, using LARS optimizer with the pretraining hyper-parameters also yield similar results. Furthermore, we find that attaching the linear classifier on top of the base encoder (with a stop_gradient on the input to linear classifier to prevent the label information from influencing the encoder) and train them simultaneously during the pretraining achieves similar performance.

## B.7. Correlation Between Linear Evaluation and Fine-Tuning

Here we study the correlation between linear evaluation and fine-tuning under different settings of training step and network architecture. For other datasets, we held out a subset of the training set for validation while performing hyperparameter tuning. After selecting the optimal hyperparameters on the validation set, we retrained the model using the selected parameters using all training and validation images. We report accuracy on the test set.

Transfer Learning via a Linear Classifier We trained an 2 -regularized multinomial logistic regression classifier on features extracted from the frozen pretrained network. We used L-BFGS to optimize the softmax cross-entropy objective and we did not apply data augmentation. As preprocessing, all images were resized to 224 pixels along the shorter side using bicubic resampling, after which we took a 224 × 224 center crop. We selected the 2 regularization parameter from a range of 45 logarithmically spaced values between 10 -6 and 10 5 .

Transfer Learning via Fine-Tuning We fine-tuned the entire network using the weights of the pretrained network as initialization. We trained for 20,000 steps at a batch size of 256 using SGD with Nesterov momentum with a momentum parameter of 0.9. We set the momentum parameter for the batch normalization statistics to max(1 -10/s, 0.9) where s is the number of steps per epoch. As data augmentation during fine-tuning, we performed only random crops with resize and flips; in contrast to pretraining, we did not perform color augmentation or blurring. At test time, we resized images to 256 pixels along the shorter side and took a 224 × 224 center crop. (Additional accuracy improvements may be possible with further optimization of data augmentation, particularly on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.) We selected the learning rate and weight decay, with a grid of 7 logarithmically spaced learning rates between 0.0001 and 0.1 and 7 logarithmically spaced values of weight decay between 10 -6 and 10 -3 , as well as no weight decay. We divide these values of weight decay by the learning rate.

Training from Random Initialization We trained the network from random initialization using the same procedure as for fine-tuning, but for longer, and with an altered hyperparameter grid. We chose hyperparameters from a grid of 7 logarithmically spaced learning rates between 0.001 and 1.0 and 8 logarithmically spaced values of weight decay between 10 -5 and 10 -1.5 . Importantly, our random initialization baselines are trained for 40,000 steps, which is sufficiently long to achieve near-maximal accuracy, as demonstrated in Figure [8](#fig_9) of [Kornblith et al. (2019)](#b32).

On Birdsnap, there are no statistically significant differences among methods, and on Food-101, Stanford Cars, and FGVC Aircraft datasets, fine-tuning provides only a small advantage over training from random initialization. However, on the remaining 8 datasets, pretraining has clear advantages.

## Supervised Baselines

We compare against architecturally identical ResNet models trained on ImageNet with standard cross-entropy loss. These models are trained with the same data augmentation as our self-supervised models (crops, strong color augmentation, and blur) and are also trained for 1000 epochs. We found that, although stronger data augmentation and longer training time do not benefit accuracy on ImageNet, these models performed significantly better than a supervised baseline trained for 90 epochs and ordinary data augmentation for linear evaluation on a subset of transfer datasets. The supervised ResNet-50 baseline achieves 76.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, vs. 69.3% for the self-supervised counterpart, while the ResNet-50 (4×) baseline achieves 78.3%, vs. 76.5% for the self-supervised model.

## Statistical Significance Testing

We test for the significance of differences between model with a permutation test. Given predictions of two models, we generate 100,000 samples from the null distribution by randomly exchanging predictions for each example and computing the difference in accuracy after performing this randomization. We then compute the percentage of samples from the null distribution that are more extreme than the observed difference in predictions. For top-1 accuracy, this procedure yields the same result as the exact McNemar test. The assumption of exchangeability under the null hypothesis is also valid for mean per-class accuracy, but not when computing average precision curves. Thus, we perform significance testing for a difference in accuracy on VOC 2007 rather than a difference in mAP. A caveat of this procedure is that it does not consider run-to-run variability when training the models, only variability arising from using a finite sample of images for evaluation.

## B.8.2. RESULTS WITH STANDARD RESNET

The ResNet-50 (4×) results shown in

Table 8 of the text show no clear advantage to the supervised or self-supervised models. With the narrower ResNet-50 architecture, however, supervised learning maintains a clear advantage over self-supervised learning. The supervised ResNet-50 model outperforms the self-supervised model on all datasets with linear evaluation, and most (10 of 12) datasets with fine-tuning.

The self-supervised ResNet gets 69.3% top-1 accuracy, 6.8% worse than the supervised model in absolute terms, whereas the self-supervised ResNet (4×) model gets 76.5%, which is only 1.8% worse than the supervised model.

## B.9. CIFAR-10

While we focus on using ImageNet as the main dataset for pretraining our unsupervised model, our method also works with other datasets. We demonstrate it by testing on CIFAR-10 as follows.

Setup As our goal is not to optimize CIFAR-10 performance, but rather to provide further confirmation of our observations on ImageNet, we use the same architecture (ResNet-50) for CIFAR-10 experiments. Because CIFAR-10 images are much smaller than ImageNet images, we replace the first 7x7 Conv of stride 2 with 3x3 Conv of stride 1, and also remove the first max pooling operation. For data augmentation, we use the same Inception crop (flip and resize to 32x32) as ImageNet, [15](#foot_5) and color distortion (strength=0.5), leaving out Gaussian blur. We pretrain with learning rate in {0.5, 1.0, 1.5}, temperature in {0.1, 0.5, 1.0}, and batch size in {256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096}. The rest of the settings (including optimizer, weight decay, etc.) are the same as our ImageNet training.

Our best model trained with batch size 1024 can achieve a linear evaluation accuracy of 94.0%, compared to 95.1% from the supervised baseline using the same architecture and batch size. The best self-supervised model that reports linear evaluation result on CIFAR-10 is AMDIM [(Bachman et al., 2019)](#b1), which achieves 91.2% with a model 25× larger than ours. We note that our model can be improved by incorporating extra data augmentations as well as using a more suitable base network. representations of two augmented views for prediction, so we can use standard and more powerful ResNets. Our NT-Xent loss function leverages normalization and temperature to restrict the range of similarity scores, whereas they use a tanh function with regularization. We use a simpler data augmentation policy, while they use FastAutoAugment for their best result.

• CPC v1 and v2 [(Oord et al., 2018;](#b43)[Hénaff et al., 2019)](#b24) define the context prediction task using a deterministic strategy to split examples into patches, and a context aggregation network (a PixelCNN) to aggregate these patches. The base encoder network sees only patches, which are considerably smaller than the original image. We decouple the prediction task and the encoder architecture, so we do not require a context aggregation network, and our encoder can look at the images of wider spectrum of resolutions. In addition, we use the NT-Xent loss function, which leverages normalization and temperature, whereas they use an unnormalized cross-entropy-based objective. We use simpler data augmentation.

• InstDisc, MoCo, PIRL [(Wu et al., 2018;](#b53)[He et al., 2019;](#b23)[Misra & van der Maaten, 2019)](#b40) generalize the Exemplar approach originally proposed by [Dosovitskiy et al. (2014)](#b15) and leverage an explicit memory bank. We do not use a memory bank; we find that, with a larger batch size, in-batch negative example sampling suffices. We also utilize a nonlinear projection head, and use the representation before the projection head. Although we use similar types of augmentations (e.g., random crop and color distortion), we expect specific parameters may be different.

• CMC [(Tian et al., 2019)](#b51) uses a separated network for each view, while we simply use a single network shared for all randomly augmented views. The data augmentation, projection head and loss function are also different. We use larger batch size instead of a memory bank.

• Whereas [Ye et al. (2019)](#b56) maximize similarity between augmented and unaugmented copies of the same image, we apply data augmentation symmetrically to both branches of our framework (Figure [2](#fig_13)). We also apply a nonlinear projection on the output of base feature network, and use the representation before projection network, whereas [Ye et al. (2019)](#b56) use the linearly projected final hidden vector as the representation. When training with large batch sizes using multiple accelerators, we use global BN to avoid shortcuts that can greatly decrease representation quality.

Although max performance is not reached in 100 epochs, reasonable results are achieved, allowing fair and efficient ablations.

Supervised models are trained for 90 epochs; longer training improves performance of stronger augmentation by ∼ 0.5%.

Training longer does not improve supervised ResNets (see Appendix B.3).

Details can be found in Appendix B.10. For simplicity, we only consider the negatives from one augmentation view.

It is 80.1% top-1 / 95.2% top-5 without broader augmentations for pretraining SimCLR.

It is worth noting that, although CIFAR-10 images are much smaller than ImageNet images and image size does not differ among examples, cropping with resizing is still a very effective augmentation for contrastive learning.
