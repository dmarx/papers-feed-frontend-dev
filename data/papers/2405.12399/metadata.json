  "abstract": "World models constitute a promising approach for training reinforcement\nlearning agents in a safe and sample-efficient manner. Recent world models\npredominantly operate on sequences of discrete latent variables to model\nenvironment dynamics. However, this compression into a compact discrete\nrepresentation may ignore visual details that are important for reinforcement\nlearning. Concurrently, diffusion models have become a dominant approach for\nimage generation, challenging well-established methods modeling discrete\nlatents. Motivated by this paradigm shift, we introduce DIAMOND (DIffusion As a\nModel Of eNvironment Dreams), a reinforcement learning agent trained in a\ndiffusion world model. We analyze the key design choices that are required to\nmake diffusion suitable for world modeling, and demonstrate how improved visual\ndetails can lead to improved agent performance. DIAMOND achieves a mean human\nnormalized score of 1.46 on the competitive Atari 100k benchmark; a new best\nfor agents trained entirely within a world model. We further demonstrate that\nDIAMOND's diffusion world model can stand alone as an interactive neural game\nengine by training on static Counter-Strike: Global Offensive gameplay. To\nfoster future research on diffusion for world modeling, we release our code,\nagents, videos and playable world models at https://diamond-wm.github.io.",
