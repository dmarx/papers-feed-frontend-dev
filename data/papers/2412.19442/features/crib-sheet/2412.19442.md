- **Key Concepts of LLMs**: 
  - Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language processing, computer vision, and multi-modal tasks.
  - They utilize the transformer architecture, particularly the decoder component, for efficient context understanding.

- **KV Cache Management**: 
  - Key-Value (KV) cache management is crucial for accelerating LLM inference by reducing redundant computations.
  - The KV cache stores key and value matrices from previous decoding steps, enabling their reuse.

- **Auto-regressive Generation**: 
  - LLMs generate text token by token, conditioning each token on previously generated ones.
  - The conditional probability for the next token is modeled as:
    \[
    P(x_{t+1} | x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_t) = \text{Softmax}(h_t W_{\text{out}} + b_{\text{out}})
    \]

- **Transformer Architecture**: 
  - Composed of stacked Transformer blocks with Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) and Feed Forward Network (FFN).
  - Key equations for MHSA:
    \[
    Q_i = XW_{Qi}, \quad K_i = XW_{Ki}, \quad V_i = XW_{Vi}
    \]
    \[
    Z_i = \text{Attention}(Q_i, K_i, V_i) = \text{Softmax}\left(\frac{Q_i K_i^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} V_i\right)
    \]
