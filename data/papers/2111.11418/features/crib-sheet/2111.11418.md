- **MetaFormer Architecture**: General architecture abstracted from Transformers, where the token mixer is unspecified. Key components include:
  - **Input Embedding**: 
    \[
    X = \text{InputEmb}(I)
    \]
    where \(X \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times C}\) (N: sequence length, C: embedding dimension).
  - **Token Mixer**: 
    \[
    Y = \text{TokenMixer}(\text{Norm}(X)) + X
    \]
  - **MLP Block**: 
    \[
    Z = \sigma(\text{Norm}(Y) W_1) W_2 + Y
    \]
    where \(W_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{C \times rC}\) and \(W_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{rC \times C}\).

- **PoolFormer**: A model derived from MetaFormer using pooling as a token mixer, demonstrating competitive performance with minimal complexity.
  - **Pooling Operation**: 
    \[
    T'[:,i,j] = \frac{1}{K \times K} \sum_{p,q=1}^{K} T[:,i+p-\frac{K}{2},i+q-\frac{K}{2}] - T[:,i,j]
    \]
  - **Performance**: PoolFormer-M36 achieves 82.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, outperforming DeiT and ResMLP with fewer parameters and MACs.

- **Performance Metrics**: 
  - PoolFormer-M36: 82.1% accuracy, 35% fewer parameters than DeiT, 50% fewer MACs.
  - Comparison with other models:
    - **DeiT**: 81.8% accuracy, higher MACs.
    - **ResMLP**: 79.4% accuracy, significantly more parameters and MACs.

- **Training Setup**: 
  - Dataset: ImageNet-1K (1.3M training images).
  - Techniques: MixUp, CutMix, CutOut, RandAugment.
  - Optimizer: AdamW with weight decay, learning rate adjustments.

- **Modified Layer Normalization (MLN)**: 
  - Computes mean and variance along token and channel dimensions, implemented using GroupNorm in PyTorch.

- **Key Contributions**: 
  - Establishes MetaFormer as a fundamental architecture for vision models.
  - Demonstrates that simple token mixers (like pooling) can achieve competitive performance, challenging the focus on complex token mixer designs.

- **Future Directions**: Encourages research on improving MetaFormer architecture rather than solely on token mixer modules.
