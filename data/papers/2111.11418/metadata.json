  "abstract": "Transformers have shown great potential in computer vision tasks. A common\nbelief is their attention-based token mixer module contributes most to their\ncompetence. However, recent works show the attention-based module in\nTransformers can be replaced by spatial MLPs and the resulted models still\nperform quite well. Based on this observation, we hypothesize that the general\narchitecture of the Transformers, instead of the specific token mixer module,\nis more essential to the model's performance. To verify this, we deliberately\nreplace the attention module in Transformers with an embarrassingly simple\nspatial pooling operator to conduct only basic token mixing. Surprisingly, we\nobserve that the derived model, termed as PoolFormer, achieves competitive\nperformance on multiple computer vision tasks. For example, on ImageNet-1K,\nPoolFormer achieves 82.1% top-1 accuracy, surpassing well-tuned Vision\nTransformer/MLP-like baselines DeiT-B/ResMLP-B24 by 0.3%/1.1% accuracy with\n35%/52% fewer parameters and 50%/62% fewer MACs. The effectiveness of\nPoolFormer verifies our hypothesis and urges us to initiate the concept of\n\"MetaFormer\", a general architecture abstracted from Transformers without\nspecifying the token mixer. Based on the extensive experiments, we argue that\nMetaFormer is the key player in achieving superior results for recent\nTransformer and MLP-like models on vision tasks. This work calls for more\nfuture research dedicated to improving MetaFormer instead of focusing on the\ntoken mixer modules. Additionally, our proposed PoolFormer could serve as a\nstarting baseline for future MetaFormer architecture design. Code is available\nat https://github.com/sail-sg/poolformer.",
