- Decision to use a supervised learning approach for hallucination detection
- Selection of Logistic Regression and Simple Neural Network as classifiers
- Choice of four numerical features for detecting hallucinations
- Use of token and vocabulary probabilities from different LLMs as evaluators
- Decision to compare performance across three different datasets
- Rationale for using different LLMs for evaluation instead of the same LLM for generation
- Implementation of feature extraction process for numerical features
- Decision to focus on empirical results rather than theoretical analysis
- Choice of specific numerical features: Minimum Token Probability, Average Token Probability, Maximum LLM E Probability Deviation, Minimum LLM E Probability Spread
- Decision to release code publicly on GitHub
- Consideration of ethical implications of hallucinations in LLM outputs
- Decision to conduct ablation analysis for feature importance
- Rationale for using a simpler classifier alongside a neural network
- Decision to evaluate the impact of LLM size on hallucination detection performance
- Choice to highlight strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art approaches
