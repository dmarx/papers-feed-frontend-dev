- **Societal Objective Functions**: Method for integrating social scientific constructs into AI objective functions to mitigate societal harms in social media.
  
- **Democratic Attitude Model**: AI model that rates social media posts based on their impact on anti-democratic attitudes using zero-shot prompts to a large language model (LLM).

- **Anti-Democratic Attitudes**: Eight variables measuring willingness to engage in the democratic process:
  1. Partisan animosity
  2. Support for undemocratic practices
  3. Support for partisan violence
  4. Support for undemocratic candidates
  5. Opposition to bipartisanship
  6. Social distrust
  7. Social distance
  8. Biased evaluation of politicized facts

- **Study 1 Findings**: Manual annotation of social media posts (Krippendorff's α = .895) showed that downranking (d = .25) and removal (d = .20) of posts reduced partisan animosity without compromising user engagement.

- **Study 2 Findings**: The democratic attitude model correlated highly with manual labels (Spearman's ρ = .75), validating the model's effectiveness in scaling up the manual ratings using LLMs.

- **Study 3 Findings**: Replication of Study 1 using the democratic attitude model confirmed significant reductions in partisan animosity (d = .25) with no perceived threats to freedom of speech.

- **Algorithmic Feed Ranking**: Traditional methods focus on engagement metrics (likes, clicks), which can amplify partisan animosity; societal objective functions aim to prioritize democratic values instead.

- **Implications for Future Work**: The method can be adapted to incorporate other societal values (e.g., wellbeing, cultural diversity) into social media algorithms, promoting a more explicit and tunable value system in AI.

- **Key Terms**:
  - **Democratic Attitude Feed**: A re-ranked social media feed that utilizes the democratic attitude model for content moderation.
  - **Partisan Animosity**: Defined as negative thoughts, feelings, and behaviors towards a political out-group.
