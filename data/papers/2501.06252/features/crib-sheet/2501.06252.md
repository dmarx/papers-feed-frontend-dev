- **Self-Adaptive LLMs**: Definition and significance; ability to modify behavior in response to task changes without external intervention.
  
- **Transformer 2 Framework**: A self-adaptation framework for LLMs that dynamically adjusts behavior using pre-trained expert vectors.

- **Two-Pass Inference Mechanism**:
  - **First Pass**: Dispatch system identifies task properties.
  - **Second Pass**: Combines task-specific expert vectors to modify base weights.

- **Singular Value Fine-tuning (SVF)**:
  - A novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that tunes singular values of weight matrices.
  - Reduces overfitting risk and computational demands while allowing compositionality.

- **Expert Vectors**: 
  - Trained using reinforcement learning (RL) on narrow datasets.
  - Each vector specializes in specific tasks, enhancing adaptability.

- **Adaptation Strategies**: Three strategies implemented within Transformer 2 to effectively dispatch SVF-trained experts based on task requirements.

- **Comparison with LoRA**: Transformer 2 outperforms LoRA in efficiency and parameter usage, achieving better performance with fewer parameters.

- **MoE Systems**: Transformer 2 employs sample-level module selection, contrasting with traditional token-level routing in MoE systems.

- **Evaluation Results**: 
  - SVF consistently outperforms traditional fine-tuning methods.
  - Transformer 2 adapts effectively to out-of-distribution tasks, such as visual question answering.

- **Key Technical Contributions**:
  - Development of a universal blueprint for self-adaptive LLMs.
  - Introduction of SVF for compact expert vector generation.
  - Implementation of adaptive strategies for expert vector combination.

- **SVD in LLM Fine-tuning**: 
  - Decomposition of weight matrices into components using SVD: \( W = U \Sigma V^T \).
  - Each singular component processes input independently, modulated by singular values.

- **Cross-Entropy Method (CEM)**: A Monte Carlo method for optimization, minimizing KL divergence between target and maintained distributions.

- **Performance Benefits**: Increasing benefits observed with additional access to test-time conditions, allowing for recycling of pre-trained SVF experts across architectures.
