The decisions made by the researchers in the paper on generalizing gradient descent with complex-valued momentum for optimization in games are grounded in both theoretical and practical considerations. Below is a detailed technical explanation and rationale for each of the key decisions outlined in your request:

### 1. Decision to Generalize Gradient Descent with Complex-Valued Momentum
**Rationale:** The introduction of complex-valued momentum allows for a richer representation of the optimization landscape, particularly in games where the dynamics can be inherently complex. Traditional real-valued momentum methods may struggle with convergence in scenarios characterized by complex eigenvalues, which are common in adversarial settings. By utilizing complex numbers, the researchers can leverage the oscillatory nature of complex exponentials to navigate the optimization landscape more effectively, potentially leading to faster convergence and better solutions.

### 2. Choice of Bilinear Zero-Sum Games for Theoretical Convergence Proof
**Rationale:** Bilinear zero-sum games provide a well-defined mathematical framework that simplifies the analysis of convergence properties. These games allow for clear definitions of player strategies and payoffs, making it easier to derive theoretical guarantees about the behavior of the proposed optimization method. The bilinear structure also aligns well with the gradient descent framework, facilitating the application of existing mathematical tools and results.

### 3. Adoption of Simultaneous and Alternating Update Strategies
**Rationale:** The simultaneous update strategy allows both players in a game to update their parameters based on the current state of the other player, which is essential for capturing the dynamics of competitive scenarios like GANs. Alternating updates, on the other hand, are common in practice and can lead to more stable convergence in certain contexts. By incorporating both strategies, the researchers aim to provide a flexible optimization framework that can adapt to different game dynamics and improve convergence rates.

### 4. Implementation of Complex-Valued Adam Variant
**Rationale:** The Adam optimizer is widely used due to its adaptive learning rate capabilities, which can significantly enhance convergence speed. By extending Adam to handle complex-valued momentum, the researchers aim to combine the benefits of adaptive learning rates with the advantages of complex momentum. This hybrid approach is expected to yield better performance in training deep learning models, particularly in adversarial settings.

### 5. Selection of Recurrently Linked Momentum Buffers
**Rationale:** Recurrently linked momentum buffers allow for the incorporation of historical gradient information in a way that can capture both cooperative and adversarial dynamics. This setup enables the optimization process to oscillate between adding and subtracting gradients, which can help mitigate issues related to rotational dynamics in the parameter space. The recurrent structure also facilitates the use of complex numbers, as it can be interpreted as a complex buffer with real and imaginary components.

### 6. Use of Negative Momentum Coefficients for Convergence in Adversarial Games
**Rationale:** Negative momentum coefficients can counteract the effects of opposing gradients, which is particularly useful in adversarial settings where players may have conflicting objectives. By allowing for negative momentum, the researchers can stabilize the optimization process and improve convergence rates, especially in scenarios where traditional positive momentum methods fail.

### 7. Decision to Focus on First-Order Methods for Optimization
**Rationale:** First-order methods are generally more computationally efficient and easier to implement than higher-order methods, which often require more complex calculations and can be less scalable. By focusing on first-order methods, the researchers aim to maintain a balance between performance and computational efficiency, making their approach more practical for real-world applications.

### 8. Choice to Utilize Real-Valued Parameter Updates
**Rationale:** While the momentum itself is complex-valued, the decision to produce real-valued parameter updates simplifies the integration of the proposed method into existing frameworks and libraries. This choice ensures compatibility with standard optimization routines and allows for easier adoption by practitioners.

### 9. Adoption of Complex Analysis for Gaining Intuitions
**Rationale:** Complex analysis provides powerful tools and insights that can help understand the behavior of complex-valued functions and their gradients. By leveraging concepts from complex analysis, the researchers can gain deeper insights into the dynamics of their optimization method, particularly in relation to convergence and stability.

### 10. Decision to Implement in Libraries Supporting Complex Arithmetic
**Rationale:** Implementing the method in libraries that support complex arithmetic ensures that the proposed optimizers can be easily utilized in existing deep learning frameworks. This decision enhances the accessibility and usability of the method, allowing practitioners to leverage complex momentum without needing to modify their existing codebases significantly.

### 11. Choice of Optimizer Parameters for Robustness in Different Eigenspace Mixtures
**Rationale:** The optimization landscape in games can vary significantly depending on the mixture of cooperative and adversarial eigenspaces. By carefully selecting optimizer parameters, the researchers aim to ensure that their method remains robust across a wide range of scenarios, improving its applicability in diverse settings.

### 12. Decision to Empirically Validate Improvements in GAN Training
**Rationale:** Empirical validation is crucial for demonstrating the practical effectiveness of the proposed method. By testing the method in the
