  "abstract": "Making language models bigger does not inherently make them better at\nfollowing a user's intent. For example, large language models can generate\noutputs that are untruthful, toxic, or simply not helpful to the user. In other\nwords, these models are not aligned with their users. In this paper, we show an\navenue for aligning language models with user intent on a wide range of tasks\nby fine-tuning with human feedback. Starting with a set of labeler-written\nprompts and prompts submitted through the OpenAI API, we collect a dataset of\nlabeler demonstrations of the desired model behavior, which we use to fine-tune\nGPT-3 using supervised learning. We then collect a dataset of rankings of model\noutputs, which we use to further fine-tune this supervised model using\nreinforcement learning from human feedback. We call the resulting models\nInstructGPT. In human evaluations on our prompt distribution, outputs from the\n1.3B parameter InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs from the 175B GPT-3,\ndespite having 100x fewer parameters. Moreover, InstructGPT models show\nimprovements in truthfulness and reductions in toxic output generation while\nhaving minimal performance regressions on public NLP datasets. Even though\nInstructGPT still makes simple mistakes, our results show that fine-tuning with\nhuman feedback is a promising direction for aligning language models with human\nintent.",
