- **TurboRAG Overview**: A novel RAG system that pre-computes and stores key-value (KV) caches offline to reduce computation overhead and time-to-first-token (TTFT) during inference.
  
- **Key Contributions**:
  - Decomposes the prefill stage into offline and online phases.
  - Introduces techniques to handle attention mask and position IDs, maintaining model accuracy.
  - Achieves up to 9.4x reduction in TTFT with comparable accuracy to standard RAG systems.

- **Problem Formalization**:
  - Given a user query \( q \), retrieve top \( k \) document chunks \( [c_1, \ldots, c_k] \).
  - Prefill computation: \( [c_1, \ldots, c_k, q] \) to obtain hidden states \( X_c \).
  - Attention score computation:
    \[
    Q_t = X_t W_Q, \quad K_i = X_{c_i} W_K, \quad V_i = X_{c_i} W_V
    \]
    \[
    \text{Attention scores} = \frac{Q_t K_i^T}{\sqrt{d}}
    \]

- **Attention Mechanism**:
  - Utilizes relative position embeddings (RoPE) for attention:
    \[
    Q'_{t} = Q_t \oplus \text{PositionEmbedding}(t)
    \]
  - Causal masking applied to ensure autoregressive property:
    \[
    \text{Attention scores} = \text{Attention scores} \times M
    \]

- **KV Cache Utilization**:
  - TurboRAG directly uses precomputed KV caches to avoid redundant computation during online inference.
  - Reduces computational resource utilization by 98.46% compared to standard RAG.

- **Experimental Results**:
  - TurboRAG demonstrates an average TTFT reduction of 8.6x across various RAG benchmarks.
  - Maintains accuracy comparable to conventional RAG systems.

- **Attention Mask Matrix**:
  - Sparse attention scores among different document chunks; primarily focuses on internal information.
  - Independent attention mask matrix allows for efficient KV cache integration.

- **Positional Embedding Insights**:
  - Relative positional embeddings are invariant to the method of KV cache computation (individual vs. concatenated).
  
- **Applications**:
  - TurboRAG is applicable to various large language models and tasks, enhancing performance in latency-sensitive applications like question answering and content generation.

- **Future Work Directions**:
  - Explore further optimizations in multi-document retrieval and integration.
  - Investigate the impact of TurboRAG on different model architectures and tasks.
