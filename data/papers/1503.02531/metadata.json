  "authors": "Geoffrey Hinton, Oriol Vinyals, Jeff Dean",
  "abstract": "A very simple way to improve the performance of almost any machine learning\nalgorithm is to train many different models on the same data and then to\naverage their predictions. Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole\nensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to\nallow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual\nmodels are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it\nis possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which\nis much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different\ncompression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show\nthat we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used\ncommercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a\nsingle model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more\nfull models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained\nclasses that the full models confuse. Unlike a mixture of experts, these\nspecialist models can be trained rapidly and in parallel.",
