- **Problem Statement**: GAN training is unstable in high dimensions due to the true data distribution being concentrated in a small fraction of the ambient space, leading to quick classification of generated samples as fake by the discriminator.

- **Proposed Solution**: Train a single generator against multiple discriminators, each analyzing a different random low-dimensional projection of the data, to provide meaningful gradients throughout training.

- **Key Objective**: The generator learns to produce samples that satisfy all discriminators simultaneously, effectively matching the full data distribution.

- **Training Objective**: 
  \[
  \min_G \max_{D_k} V(D_k, G) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \left( E_{x \sim P_x} [\log D_k(W_k^T x)] + E_{z \sim P_z} [\log(1 - D_k(W_k^T G(z)))] \right)
  \]
  where \( W_k \) is a randomly chosen projection matrix.

- **Discriminator Architecture**: Each discriminator uses convolutional architectures to handle projected inputs, with projection matrices \( W_k \) designed to produce "image-like" data through strided convolutions with random filters.

- **Stability Mechanism**: Low-dimensional projections create an information bottleneck, preventing discriminators from perfectly classifying samples, thus maintaining a flow of meaningful gradients to the generator.

- **Consistency Mechanism**: The optimal generator outputs \( P_g \) must match the marginals of the true distribution along each projection:
  \[
  D_k(y) = \frac{P_{W_k}^T x(y)}{P_{W_k}^T x(y) + P_{W_k}^T g(y)}
  \]
  for all \( k \in \{1, \ldots, K\} \).

- **Empirical Results**: The proposed method produces higher-quality image samples compared to traditional single discriminator training, demonstrating practical utility.

- **Related Work**: Previous methods to stabilize GAN training include Wasserstein GANs, Energy-based GANs, and various heuristics for improving gradient quality, which can complement the proposed approach.
