The research presented in the thesis "Adversarial Perturbations Cannot Reliably Protect Artists From Generative AI" provides a comprehensive examination of the effectiveness of current style mimicry protection tools against generative AI misuse. Below is a detailed technical explanation and rationale for the researchers' decisions regarding the main thesis, key findings, protection tools, robust mimicry methods, evaluation protocols, limitations of current protections, threat model, and recommendations.

### Main Thesis
**Adversarial perturbations in style mimicry protections do not reliably safeguard artists from generative AI misuse.**

**Rationale**: The researchers argue that while adversarial perturbations are designed to disrupt the ability of generative models to replicate an artist's style, they ultimately fail to provide a robust defense. This conclusion is based on empirical evidence demonstrating that these perturbations can be easily circumvented by forgers using simple techniques. The thesis highlights the inadequacy of current protective measures in the face of evolving generative AI capabilities.

### Key Findings
1. **Ineffectiveness of Popular Protection Tools**: Tools like Glaze, Mist, and Anti-DreamBooth do not withstand robust mimicry methods.
   - **Rationale**: The researchers conducted systematic evaluations that revealed these tools' limitations when faced with adaptive and low-effort mimicry strategies. The findings suggest that the protections are not as robust as claimed, leading to a false sense of security for artists.

2. **Low-Effort Techniques Bypass Protections**: Simple methods such as image upscaling and adding Gaussian noise can effectively bypass existing protections.
   - **Rationale**: The researchers demonstrated that these techniques, which are widely accessible and easy to implement, can neutralize the effects of adversarial perturbations. This finding underscores the vulnerability of the protections and the ease with which they can be circumvented.

3. **User Study Results**: The user study confirmed that artworks generated using robust mimicry methods were indistinguishable in quality from those created from unprotected artworks.
   - **Rationale**: By involving human observers in the evaluation, the researchers provided a more reliable measure of mimicry success than automated metrics. This approach highlights the practical implications of the findings, emphasizing that the quality of generated art can be comparable to the original, protected works.

### Protection Tools
- **Glaze**: Perturbs images to disrupt the encoder in latent diffusion models.
- **Mist**: Similar to Glaze, it targets the encoder and claims robustness against certain purification methods.
- **Anti-DreamBooth**: Targets the denoiser to maximize prediction error on perturbed images.

**Rationale**: The researchers selected these tools for evaluation due to their popularity and widespread adoption among artists. By focusing on these specific tools, the study aims to provide insights into the current state of protection mechanisms and their limitations.

### Robust Mimicry Methods
- **Low-Effort Strategies**: Techniques like different finetuning scripts or adding Gaussian noise.
- **Multi-Step Strategies**: Combining various off-the-shelf tools for effective mimicry.

**Rationale**: The researchers emphasize that robust mimicry methods do not require advanced skills or resources, making them accessible to a wide range of forgers. This accessibility raises concerns about the effectiveness of existing protections, as even low-skilled individuals can successfully replicate an artist's style.

### Evaluation Protocol
- **Unified Evaluation**: The researchers implemented a standardized evaluation across various artists and prompts to assess protection effectiveness.
- **User Study Methodology**: This involved measuring mimicry success and quality through human judgment.

**Rationale**: The unified evaluation protocol addresses the inconsistencies in previous studies, allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of protection tools. The user study methodology provides a qualitative measure of success that is more reflective of real-world scenarios.

### Limitations of Current Protections
1. **Lack of Generalization**: Protections do not generalize across different finetuning setups.
2. **Non-Comprehensive Evaluations**: Existing evaluations often rely on unreliable automated metrics.

**Rationale**: The researchers highlight these limitations to emphasize the inherent weaknesses in current protection strategies. By identifying these flaws, they advocate for a reevaluation of how protections are assessed and the need for more robust solutions.

### Threat Model
- **Forger Control**: The forger has full control over protected images and the finetuning process.
- **Success Definition**: Success is defined as generating images that a human observer identifies as the artist's style.

**Rationale**: The threat model establishes a realistic scenario in which forgers operate, emphasizing the challenges artists face in protecting their work. This model underscores the need for protections that can withstand determined attempts to replicate artistic styles.

### Recommendations
- **Need for Alternative Solutions**: The researchers call for the development of protective measures beyond adversarial perturbations.
- **Acknowledgment of Disadvantage**: They highlight the inherent disadvantage for artists in the current protection landscape.

**Rationale**: The recommendations stem from the findings that current protections
