- **Main Thesis**: Adversarial perturbations in style mimicry protections do not reliably safeguard artists from generative AI misuse.
  
- **Key Findings**:
  - Popular protection tools (Glaze, Mist, Anti-DreamBooth) are ineffective against robust mimicry methods.
  - Low-effort techniques (e.g., image upscaling, Gaussian noise) can bypass existing protections.
  - User study confirms indistinguishable quality between protected and unprotected artworks when using robust mimicry methods.

- **Protection Tools**:
  - **Glaze**: Perturbs images to disrupt encoder in latent diffusion models.
  - **Mist**: Similar to Glaze, targets encoder; claims robustness against certain purification methods.
  - **Anti-DreamBooth**: Targets denoiser, maximizing prediction error on perturbed images.

- **Robust Mimicry Methods**:
  - **Low-effort strategies**: Use different finetuning scripts or add Gaussian noise.
  - **Multi-step strategies**: Combine off-the-shelf tools for effective mimicry.
  
- **Evaluation Protocol**:
  - Unified evaluation across various artists and prompts to assess protection effectiveness.
  - User study methodology to measure mimicry success and quality.

- **Limitations of Current Protections**:
  - Protections do not generalize across different finetuning setups.
  - Existing evaluations are often non-comprehensive and rely on unreliable automated metrics.

- **Threat Model**:
  - Forger has full control over protected images and finetuning process.
  - Success defined as generating images that a human observer identifies as the artist's style.

- **Recommendations**:
  - Urgent need for alternative protective solutions beyond adversarial perturbations.
  - Acknowledge the inherent disadvantage for artists in the current protection landscape.
