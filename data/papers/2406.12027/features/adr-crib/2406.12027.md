Here are detailed technical explanations and justifications for the researchers' decisions regarding the evaluation of style mimicry protection tools:

### 1. Decision to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Existing Style Mimicry Protection Tools
The researchers aimed to assess the real-world effectiveness of existing protection tools, as there was a lack of empirical evidence regarding their efficacy. Given the significant media attention and widespread adoption of these tools, it was crucial to determine whether they genuinely provide the intended protection for artists against style mimicry. This evaluation is essential for informing artists about the actual risks and the effectiveness of the tools they might use.

### 2. Choice of Adversarial Perturbations as a Protection Mechanism
Adversarial perturbations were chosen because they represent a common approach in machine learning to disrupt model performance. These perturbations are designed to be subtle enough that they do not significantly alter the visual appearance of the artwork while still being effective at hindering the finetuning process of generative models. This method aligns with the goal of protecting artists' styles without compromising the integrity of their original works.

### 3. Selection of Specific Protection Tools for Analysis (Glaze, Mist, Anti-DreamBooth)
The selected tools—Glaze, Mist, and Anti-DreamBooth—are among the most popular and widely downloaded style mimicry protection tools available. Their prominence in the field made them suitable candidates for evaluation. Additionally, these tools employ different mechanisms for protection, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of various approaches to style mimicry protection.

### 4. Methodology for User Study to Assess Protection Effectiveness
The researchers conducted a user study to gather qualitative data on the effectiveness of the protection tools. This methodology was chosen to provide a more nuanced understanding of mimicry success, as human judgment is critical in assessing whether generated images convincingly replicate an artist's style. The user study allowed for direct feedback on the visual quality of the images produced using both protected and unprotected artworks.

### 5. Decision to Use Low-Effort and Off-the-Shelf Techniques for Robust Mimicry
The choice to utilize low-effort and off-the-shelf techniques was made to demonstrate that even non-expert forgers could easily bypass existing protections. This decision highlights the accessibility of robust mimicry methods, emphasizing the inadequacy of current protection tools. By using readily available techniques, the researchers aimed to illustrate the vulnerabilities in the protection mechanisms without requiring specialized knowledge or resources.

### 6. Choice of Metrics for Evaluating Mimicry Success
The researchers opted for metrics that reflect human perception of style mimicry rather than relying solely on automated metrics, which can be misleading. This choice was made to ensure that the evaluation of mimicry success aligns with the subjective experience of viewers, as the ultimate goal is to determine whether the generated images are perceived as belonging to the original artist's style.

### 7. Assumptions About the Capabilities of Forgers in the Threat Model
The researchers assumed that forgers would have access to the protected images and the ability to finetune models, reflecting a realistic threat model. This assumption is grounded in the understanding that malicious actors are likely to exploit any available resources to achieve their goals. By considering a reasonably resourced forger, the researchers aimed to create a more robust evaluation of the protection tools.

### 8. Decision to Disclose Results to Affected Protection Tools Prior to Publication
The decision to disclose results to the developers of the protection tools was made to allow them to address any vulnerabilities identified in the study. This ethical consideration reflects a commitment to responsible research practices, ensuring that the findings could lead to improvements in the protection tools and better outcomes for artists.

### 9. Choice of Historical and Contemporary Artists for Evaluation
The inclusion of both historical and contemporary artists was intended to provide a comprehensive assessment of the protection tools across different artistic styles and contexts. This diversity allows for a broader understanding of how well the protections work across various artistic expressions and helps to identify any specific vulnerabilities related to particular styles.

### 10. Decision to Focus on the Limitations of Existing Protection Tools
The researchers chose to emphasize the limitations of existing protection tools to highlight the urgent need for more effective solutions. By critically analyzing the shortcomings, the study aims to stimulate further research and development in the field of style mimicry protection, ultimately benefiting artists who are at risk of having their styles misappropriated.

### 11. Assumption That All Artist Images Available Online Are Protected
This assumption was made to create a conservative threat model, reflecting the reality that many artists may believe their work is protected when it is not. By assuming that all images are protected, the researchers aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the protections in a scenario that artists might realistically face.

### 12. Decision to Critique the Evaluation Methods of Prior Robust Mimicry Studies
The researchers critiqued prior evaluation methods to address the shortcomings in the existing literature. By highlighting these flaws, they aimed to establish a more rigorous and unified evaluation framework that could provide clearer insights into the effectiveness of protection tools and the robustness of
