- Decision to focus on video imagery for style mimicry attacks
- Choice of existing anti-mimicry tools for evaluation (Glaze, Mist, Anti-Dreambooth)
- Method for validating the effectiveness of mimicry attacks on video frames
- Approach to segmenting videos into short scenes based on frame-level similarity
- Decision to implement a per-scene optimization baseline
- Choice to develop a tool-agnostic framework (Gimbal)
- Strategy for reducing computational costs in the protection process
- Methodology for evaluating the efficacy of the proposed framework
- Design of user studies to assess visual appeal and protection effectiveness
- Decision to explore adaptive countermeasures against the proposed framework
- Approach to integrating Gimbal with existing anti-mimicry tools
- Choice of image-level metrics for evaluating protection efficacy
- Decision to analyze the impact of frame aggregation on protection robustness
- Strategy for addressing potential limitations of the proposed framework
- Consideration of ethical implications in the context of style mimicry and protection
