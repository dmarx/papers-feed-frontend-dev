- **Mimicry Attacks Overview**: Style mimicry involves fine-tuning a pretrained model on a small sample of an artist's work to generate new images in that style without consent. 

- **Existing Anti-Mimicry Tools**: Key tools include:
  - **Glaze**: Alters images to misrepresent themselves in a target model's style feature space.
  - **Mist**: Extends optimization across the diffusion process to create chaotic patterns.
  - **Anti-Dreambooth**: Targets Dreambooth models with surrogate model training for stronger protection.

- **Vulnerability of Anti-Mimicry Tools**: Naive application of these tools on video frames is vulnerable to adaptive countermeasures that exploit randomness in optimization results across consecutive frames.

- **Gimbal Framework**: 
  - **Purpose**: A tool-agnostic framework designed to protect video content from style mimicry attacks.
  - **Methodology**: Segments videos into short scenes based on frame-level similarity, applying a single baseline perturbation for all frames in a scene to reduce inter-frame randomization.
  - **Efficiency**: Reduces computational costs significantly, often by an order of magnitude.

- **Evaluation Metrics**: 
  - **Latent ùêø2 Norm**: Measures pixel-level differences between frames.
  - **Intra-frame Mean Pixel Difference**: Assesses consistency within frames.
  - **CLIP-based Genre Shift**: Evaluates perceptual shifts in generated content.

- **User Study Findings**: Over 500 participants confirmed that Gimbal provides effective protection against mimicry attacks and is visually more appealing than naive Glaze.

- **Adaptive Countermeasure**: An advanced countermeasure against Gimbal can force the framework to break sequences of similar frames into multiple scenes, but Gimbal still prevents extraction of unprotected frames.

- **Future Work**: Identifying additional adaptive mimicry algorithms, especially for longer videos, remains a challenge.

  - Validation of mimicry attacks on video frames.
  - Identification of vulnerabilities in existing anti-mimicry tools.
  - Introduction of the Gimbal framework for video protection.
