- **HunyuanVideo Overview**
  - Open-source video foundation model with 13 billion parameters.
  - Aims to bridge the gap between closed-source and open-source video generation models.

- **Key Contributions**
  - Data curation, advanced architecture design, progressive model scaling, and efficient infrastructure for large-scale training and inference.

- **Performance Metrics**
  - Outperforms state-of-the-art models (Runway Gen-3, Luma 1.6) in visual quality, motion dynamics, text-video alignment, and advanced filming techniques.

- **Data Preprocessing Techniques**
  - Joint training strategy for images and videos.
  - Videos categorized into five groups; images into two groups.
  - Compliance with GDPR using data synthesis and privacy computing.

- **Data Filtering Pipeline**
  - Utilizes PySceneDetect for video segmentation and OpenCV's Laplacian operator for frame clarity.
  - K-means clustering for concept resampling.
  - Hierarchical filtering for aesthetics, clarity, motion speed, and scene boundaries.

- **Training Datasets**
  - Five training datasets with progressively stricter filtering thresholds.
  - Final fine-tuning dataset curated through human annotation, focusing on visual aesthetics and motion details.

- **Structured Captioning**
  - In-house Vision Language Model (VLM) generates structured captions in JSON format.
  - Captions include short and dense descriptions, background, style, shot type, lighting, and atmosphere.

- **Camera Movement Classifier**
  - Classifies 14 camera movement types (e.g., zoom, pan, tilt).
  - High-confidence predictions integrated into structured captions for enhanced generative control.

- **Model Architecture**
  - Causal 3D VAE for compressing videos into latent space.
  - Compression formula: $(T ct + 1) × C × (H cs) × (W cs)$ with $c_t = 4$, $c_s = 8$, $C = 16$.

- **Training Strategy**
  - Mix of video and image data at a 4:1 ratio.
  - Loss function: 
    \[
    Loss = L_1 + 0.1L_{lpips} + 0.05L_{adv} + 10^{-6}L_{kl}
    \]
  - Curriculum learning from low-resolution to high-resolution videos.
