  "abstract": "Despite the success of diffusion models (DMs), we still lack a thorough\nunderstanding of their latent space. To understand the latent space\n$\\mathbf{x}_t \\in \\mathcal{X}$, we analyze them from a geometrical perspective.\nOur approach involves deriving the local latent basis within $\\mathcal{X}$ by\nleveraging the pullback metric associated with their encoding feature maps.\nRemarkably, our discovered local latent basis enables image editing\ncapabilities by moving $\\mathbf{x}_t$, the latent space of DMs, along the basis\nvector at specific timesteps. We further analyze how the geometric structure of\nDMs evolves over diffusion timesteps and differs across different text\nconditions. This confirms the known phenomenon of coarse-to-fine generation, as\nwell as reveals novel insights such as the discrepancy between $\\mathbf{x}_t$\nacross timesteps, the effect of dataset complexity, and the time-varying\ninfluence of text prompts. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the\nfirst to present image editing through $\\mathbf{x}$-space traversal, editing\nonly once at specific timestep $t$ without any additional training, and\nproviding thorough analyses of the latent structure of DMs. The code to\nreproduce our experiments can be found at\nhttps://github.com/enkeejunior1/Diffusion-Pullback.",
