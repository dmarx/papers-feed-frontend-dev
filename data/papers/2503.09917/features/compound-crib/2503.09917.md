## Detailed Technical Explanations and Justifications for MareNostrum5 Design Decisions

### System Overview

MareNostrum5 is designed as a pre-exascale supercomputer to meet the diverse computational needs of scientific research. The choice of a hybrid architecture, featuring Intel Sapphire Rapids CPUs and NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, allows for a balance between high-performance computing (HPC) and energy efficiency. The peak performance of **314 PFlop/s** positions MareNostrum5 among the top supercomputers globally, enabling it to handle complex simulations and data-intensive tasks.

The system is organized into four partitions: General Purpose Partition (GPP), Accelerated Partition (ACC), General Purpose - Next Generation, and Accelerated - Next Generation. This partitioning allows for specialization in workload types, optimizing resource allocation and performance for various applications.

### General Purpose Partition (GPP)

The GPP is built around dual-socket Intel Sapphire Rapids 8480+ CPUs, which provide a high core count (56 cores per socket) and a base clock speed of 2 GHz. This configuration is particularly suited for applications requiring substantial parallel processing capabilities.

#### Configurations:
1. **DDR Compute Nodes**: With 6,192 nodes equipped with 256 GB DDR5 memory, this configuration is optimized for general-purpose workloads that do not require extreme memory bandwidth.
2. **DDR-HM Compute Nodes**: The 216 nodes with 1 TB DDR5 memory cater to memory-intensive applications, providing ample capacity for large datasets.
3. **HBM Compute Nodes**: The 72 nodes with 128 GB HBM2 memory are designed for high-bandwidth applications, such as machine learning and data analytics, where memory speed is critical.

#### Power Consumption:
The power consumption metrics (11.4 kW for DDR, 12.0 kW for DDR-HM, and 10.4 kW for HBM) reflect the energy efficiency of the configurations under High-Performance Linpack (HPL) workloads. The variations in power consumption are justified by the differing memory technologies and their respective performance characteristics.

### Accelerated Partition (ACC)

The ACC is designed for workloads that benefit from GPU acceleration. It features dual Intel Sapphire Rapids 8460Y+ CPUs and four NVIDIA Hopper GPUs (H100), which provide a significant boost in computational power for parallel processing tasks.

#### Configuration:
- Each node has 512 GB DDR5 memory and 64 GB HBM2e per GPU, allowing for high throughput in data-intensive applications.
- The use of NVLink for GPU interconnectivity ensures high bandwidth (300 GB/s) between GPUs, which is crucial for applications that require rapid data exchange.

#### Power Consumption:
The ACC's power consumption of **3.5 kW** under HPL workloads demonstrates its energy efficiency, particularly given the high performance delivered by the combination of CPUs and GPUs.

### Benchmarking

The benchmarking strategy employs a tiered approach:
1. **Micro-benchmarks**: These assess fundamental performance metrics such as floating-point performance, memory bandwidth, and interconnect throughput, providing insights into the system's capabilities at a granular level.
2. **HPC Benchmarks**: HPL and HPCG results for GPP and ACC offer a comparative analysis of the partitions' performance under standardized workloads.
3. **Application Studies**: Real-world applications like Alya, OpenFOAM, and IFS are used to evaluate the system's performance in practical scenarios, ensuring that the benchmarks reflect actual usage patterns.

### Energy Efficiency

The integration of the EAR (Energy Aware Runtime) framework allows for real-time monitoring of power consumption, enabling optimization of energy usage across the system. The decision to implement direct liquid cooling is particularly significant, as it enhances thermal management and energy efficiency, especially in densely packed compute nodes.

### Memory Technologies

The comparison between HBM and DDR5 configurations highlights the trade-offs between memory speed and capacity. HBM offers higher bandwidth, making it suitable for applications that require rapid data access, while DDR5 provides larger capacities for general-purpose workloads. This strategic choice allows users to select the most appropriate memory configuration based on their specific application needs.

### Storage Infrastructure

The storage architecture is designed to support both performance and capacity needs:
- **HPC Storage**: The Elastic Storage Server (ESS-3500) configurations allow for flexible scaling, with options for high-performance NVMe storage and high-capacity HDD storage.
- **Archive Storage**: The IBM TS4500 tape system provides a robust solution for long-term data retention, ensuring that large datasets can be stored efficiently.
- **Parallel Filesystem**: The use of GPFS ensures high throughput and fault tolerance, essential for HPC environments where data integrity and access speed are critical.

### Network Architecture

The Infiniband NDR200 fabric with a three-layer fat-tree topology is designed to minimize latency and maximize bandwidth across the system. This architecture supports the high interconnect demands of both GPP and ACC partitions, facilitating efficient communication between compute nodes and storage systems.
