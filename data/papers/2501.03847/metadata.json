  "abstract": "Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance in generating\nhigh-quality videos from text prompts or images. However, precise control over\nthe video generation process, such as camera manipulation or content editing,\nremains a significant challenge. Existing methods for controlled video\ngeneration are typically limited to a single control type, lacking the\nflexibility to handle diverse control demands. In this paper, we introduce\nDiffusion as Shader (DaS), a novel approach that supports multiple video\ncontrol tasks within a unified architecture. Our key insight is that achieving\nversatile video control necessitates leveraging 3D control signals, as videos\nare fundamentally 2D renderings of dynamic 3D content. Unlike prior methods\nlimited to 2D control signals, DaS leverages 3D tracking videos as control\ninputs, making the video diffusion process inherently 3D-aware. This innovation\nallows DaS to achieve a wide range of video controls by simply manipulating the\n3D tracking videos. A further advantage of using 3D tracking videos is their\nability to effectively link frames, significantly enhancing the temporal\nconsistency of the generated videos. With just 3 days of fine-tuning on 8 H800\nGPUs using less than 10k videos, DaS demonstrates strong control capabilities\nacross diverse tasks, including mesh-to-video generation, camera control,\nmotion transfer, and object manipulation.",
