<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In the 1990s, the constant error carousel and gating were introduced as the central ideas of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.</p></div>

In reinforcement learning, LSTMs are the best performing sequence models, e.g., the AlphaStar model for StarCraft II <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Vinyals et al., 2017)</ref>, the OpenAI Five model for Dota 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Karpathy, 2019)</ref>, and models of the magnetic controller for nuclear fusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Degrave et al., 2022)</ref>. LSTMs excel at learning abstractions, i.e., adeptly extracting semantic information and storing it in their memory cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Karpathy, 2015)</ref>, which for example became evident by number and syntax neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Lakretz et al., 2019)</ref>, linguistic neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bau et al., 2019)</ref>, and sentiment neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Radford et al., 2017)</ref>.

Left: Nearest Neighbor Search problem in terms of mean squared error (MSE). Given a reference vector, a sequence is scanned sequentially for the most similar vector with the objective to return its attached value at sequence end. LSTM struggles to revise a stored value when a more similar vector is found. Our new xLSTM overcomes this limitation by exponential gating. Right: Rare Token Prediction.

We exemplify this limitation via the Nearest Neighbor Search problem (see also Appendix B): With a reference vector given, a sequence must be scanned sequentially for the most similar vector in order to provide its attached value at sequence end. The left panel of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">2</ref> shows the mean squared error at this task. LSTM struggles to revise a stored value when a more similar vector is found, while our new xLSTM remediates this limitation by exponential gating. (ii) Limited storage capacities, i.e., information must be compressed into scalar cell states. We exemplify this limitation via Rare Token Prediction. In the right panel of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">2</ref>, the perplexity of token prediction on Wikitext-103 <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Merity et al., 2017)</ref> is given for partitions of different token frequency. LSTM performs worse on rare tokens because of its limited storage capacities. Our new xLSTM solves this problem by a matrix memory. (iii) Lack of parallelizability due to memory mixing, i.e., the hidden-hidden connections between hidden states from one time step to the next, which enforce sequential processing.</p><p>These limitations of LSTM have paved the way for the emergence of Transformers <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref> in language modeling. What performances can we achieve in language modeling when overcoming these limitations and scaling LSTMs to the size of current Large Language Models?</p><p>2 Extended Long Short-Term Memory</p><p>To overcome the LSTM limitations, Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) introduces two main modifications to the LSTM idea of Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>). Those modifications -exponential gating and novel memory structures -enrich the LSTM family by two members: (i) the new sLSTM (see Section 2.2) with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and memory mixing, and (ii) the new mLSTM (see Section 2.3) with a matrix memory and a covariance (outer product) update rule, which is fully parallelizable. Both sLSTM and mLSTM enhance the LSTM through exponential gating. To enable parallelization, the mLSTM abandons memory mixing, i.e., the hidden-hidden recurrent connections. Both mLSTM and sLSTM can be extended to multiple memory cells, where sLSTM features memory mixing across cells. Further, the sLSTM can have multiple heads without memory mixing across the heads, but only memory mixing across cells within each head. This introduction of heads for sLSTM together with exponential gating establishes a new way of memory mixing. For mLSTM multiple heads and multiple cells are equivalent.</p><p>Integrating these new LSTM variants into residual block modules results in xLSTM blocks (see Section 2.4). Residually stacking those xLSTM blocks in architectures provides xLSTM architectures (see Section 2.4). See Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1</ref> for the xLSTM architecture with its components.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Review of the Long Short-Term Memory</head><p>The original LSTM idea <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Hochreiter, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hochreiter &amp; Schmidhuber, 1997b,a)</ref> introduced the scalar memory cell as a central processing and storage unit that avoids vanishing gradients <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Hochreiter, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hochreiter et al., 2000)</ref> through the constant error carousel (the cell state update). The memory cell contains three gates: input, output, and forget gate. The forget gate has been introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Gers et al. (2000)</ref>. The update rules of the LSTM memory cell at time step t are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">c t = f t c t-1 + i t z t cell state (2)</formula><p>h t = o t ht , ht = ψ c t hidden state (3)</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">z t = φ (z t ) , zt = w ⊤ z x t + r z h t-1 + b z cell input (4) i t = σ ĩt , ĩt = w ⊤ i x t + r i h t-1 + b i input gate (5) f t = σ ft , ft = w ⊤ f x t + r f h t-1 + b f forget gate (6) o t = σ (õ t ) , õt = w ⊤ o x t + r o h t-1 + b o output gate (7)</formula><p>The weight vectors w z , w i , w f , and w o correspond to the input weight vectors between inputs x t and cell input, input gate, forget gate, and output gate, respectively. The weights r z , r i , r f , and r o correspond to the recurrent weights between hidden state h t-1 and cell input, input gate, forget gate, and output gate, respectively. b z , b i , b f , and b o are the corresponding bias terms. φ and ψ are the cell input and hidden state activation functions (typically tanh). ψ is used to normalize or squash the cell state, which would be unbounded otherwise. All gate activation functions are sigmoid, i.e., σ (x) = 1/(1 + exp(-x)). In later formulations, multiple scalar memory cells c t ∈ R d were combined in a vector, which allows the usage of recurrent weight matrices R ∈ R d×d to mix the cell outputs of memory cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Greff et al., 2015)</ref>, for more details see Appendix A.1. Ablation studies showed that all components of the memory cell are crucial <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Greff et al., 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">sLSTM</head><p>To empower LSTMs with the ability to revise storage decisions, we introduce exponential gates (red) together with normalization and stabilization. In particular, input and forget gates can have exponential activation functions. For normalization, we introduce a normalizer state that sums up the product of the input gate times all future forget gates.</p><p>The scalar sLSTM forward pass is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">c t = f t c t-1 + i t z t cell state<label>(8)</label></formula><p>n t = f t n t-1 + i t normalizer state <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(9)</ref> h t = o t ht , ht = c t / n t hidden state (10)</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">z t = φ (z t ) , zt = w ⊤ z x t + r z h t-1 + b z cell input (11) i t = exp ĩt , ĩt = w ⊤ i x t + r i h t-1 + b i input gate (12) f t = σ ft OR exp ft , ft = w ⊤ f x t + r f h t-1 + b f forget gate (13) o t = σ (õ t ) , õt = w ⊤ o x t + r o h t-1 + b o output gate (14)</formula><p>We transfer the original LSTM gating techniques, i.e., input-and/or hidden-dependent gating plus bias term, to the new architectures. Exponential activation functions can lead to large values that cause overflows. Therefore, we stabilize gates with an additional state m t <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Milakov &amp; Gimelshein, 2018)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">m t =</formula><p>max log( f t ) + m t-1 , log( i t ) stabilizer state (15) i ′ t = exp log i t -m t = exp ĩt -m t stabil. input gate (16)</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">f ′ t = exp log f t + m t-1 -m t stabil. forget gate<label>(17)</label></formula><p>We show in Appendix A.2, that replacing f t by f ′ t and i t by i ′ t in the forward pass does neither change the output of the whole network nor the derivatives of the loss with respect to the parameters.</p><p>New Memory Mixing. sLSTM can have multiple memory cells like the original LSTM (see Appendix A.2). Multiple memory cells enable memory mixing via recurrent connections R z , R i , R f , R o from hidden state vector h to memory cell input z and the gates i, f , o, respectively. A new aspect in memory mixing is the effect of exponential gating. The new sLSTM can have multiple heads with memory mixing within each head but not across heads. The introduction of heads for sLSTM together with exponential gating establishes a new way of memory mixing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">mLSTM</head><p>To enhance storage capacities of LSTMs, we increase the LSTM memory cell from a scalar c ∈ R to a matrix C ∈ R d×d . Hence, retrieval is performed via a matrix multiplication. At time t, we want to store a pair of vectors, the key k t ∈ R d and the value v t ∈ R d (we use the Transformer terminology). Later at time t + τ , the value v t should be retrieved by a query vector q t+τ ∈ R d . This is the setting of Bidirectional Associative Memories (BAMs) <ref type="bibr">(Kohonen, 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderson, 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Nakano, 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Anderson et al., 1977)</ref>. The covariance update rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Sejnowski, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dayan &amp; Willshaw, 1991)</ref> for storing a key-value pair is</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">C t = C t-1 + v t k ⊤ t .<label>(18)</label></formula><p>We assume a layer-norm before projecting inputs to keys and values, therefore they have zero mean.</p><p>The covariance update rule is optimal <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Dayan &amp; Willshaw, 1991)</ref> for a maximal separability of retrieved binary vectors, which is equivalent to a maximal signal/noise ratio. Higher separability is possible when limiting retrieval to pairwise interactions and conceding quadratic complexity like attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Krotov &amp; Hopfield, 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Ramsauer et al., 2021)</ref>. The covariance update rule is equivalent to Fast Weight Programmers <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Schmidhuber, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Schlag et al., 2021)</ref>, which have later been equipped with a constant decay rate multiplied to C t-1 and a constant learning rate multiplied to v t k ⊤ t <ref type="bibr">(Ba et al., 2016a)</ref>. In this spirit, we integrate the covariance update rule into the LSTM framework, where the forget gate corresponds to decay rate and the input gate to the learning rate, while the output gate scales the retrieved vector.</p><p>For this matrix memory, the normalizer state is the weighted sum of key vectors, where each key vector is weighted by the input gate and all future forget gates. Again, the normalizer state keeps record of the strength of the gates. Since the dot product between query and normalizer state can be close to zero, we use the absolute value of this dot product and lower bound it by a threshold (typically 1.0) as done previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Sun et al., 2023)</ref>. The mLSTM forward pass is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">C t = f t C t-1 + i t v t k ⊤ t cell state (19) n t = f t n t-1 + i t k t normalizer state (20) h t = o t ⊙ ht , ht = C t q t / max n ⊤ t q t , 1 hidden state (21) q t = W q x t + b q query input (22) k t = 1 √ d W k x t + b k key input (23) v t = W v x t + b v value input (24) i t = exp ĩt , ĩt = w ⊤ i x t + b i input gate (25) f t = σ ft OR exp ft , ft = w ⊤ f x t + b f forget gate (26) o t = σ (õ t ) , õt = W o x t + b o output gate (27)</formula><p>mLSTM can have multiple memory cells like the original LSTM. For mLSTM, multiple heads and multiple cells are equivalent as there is no memory mixing. In order to stabilize the exponential gates of mLSTM, we use the same stabilization techniques as for sLSTM (see Equation <ref type="formula">15</ref>). Since the mLSTM has no memory mixing, this recurrence can be reformulated in a parallel version. For more details we refer to Appendix A.3. xLSTM Blocks. An xLSTM block should non-linearly summarize the past in a high-dimensional space to better separate different histories or contexts. Separating histories is the prerequisite to correctly predict the next sequence element such as the next token. We resort to Cover's Theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cover, 1965)</ref>, which states that in a higher dimensional space non-linearly embedded patterns can more likely be linearly separated than in the original space. We consider two residual block architectures: (i) A residual block with post upprojection (like Transformers), which non-linearly summarizes the past in the original space, then linearly maps into a high-dimensional space, applies a non-linear activation function, and linearly maps back to the original space; see left panel of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref> and third column in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1</ref>. A more detailed version is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">10</ref> in the appendix. (ii) A residual block with pre up-projection (like State Space Models), which linearly maps to a high-dimensional space, non-linearly summarizes the past in the high-dimensional space and then linearly maps back to the original space. For an xLSTM block containing an sLSTM, we use the post up-projection block. For an xLSTM block containing an mLSTM, we use the pre up-projection block since the memory capacity becomes larger in the high-dimensional space.

The accuracy of the tested methods is evaluated on those tokens relevant to the task. The accuracy is scaled between 0 (random) and 1 (perfect). We compare 2-block architectures of the following methods on these tasks: xLSTM[0:1] (i.e., only sLSTM), xLSTM[1:0] (i.e., only mLSTM), xLSTM[1:1], Llama, Mamba, RWKV, Retention, Hyena, LSTM, and LSTM in Transformer blocks (LSTM (Block)). The results of this experiment are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>. Models such as Transformers or State Space Models without memory mixing (no state tracking) cannot solve, e.g. regular grammars like the parity task.

To enhance the difficulty of the original task, we increase the number of key-value pairs up to 256 and extend the context length up to 2048. Thus, we have broader tests for the memory capacities of different models. We compare 2-block architectures of Llama, Mamba, RWKV-5, RWKV-6, xLSTM[1:1] and xLSTM[1:0].

Results are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>. xLSTM[1:1] performs best among all non-Transformer models, also for small models.

The models were trained with mixed precision, for RWKV-5, RWKV-6, GLA, HGRN2, the mixed-precision training did not utilize the PyTorch automated mixed precision (see also Appendix Section B.2). We categorize the methods into (a) Transformers, (b) State Space Models (SSMs), and (c) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) together with linear Transformers. Linear Transformers are linear methods that substitute the Transformer attention mechanism. The models match a GPT-3 model with 350M parameters in size, i.e. embedding dim 1024 and 24 residual blocks. Only GPT-3 uses shared weights for token and output embeddings, therefore has fewer parameters. The results in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> show that xLSTM outperforms all existing methods in validation perplexity. For details see Appendix B.2. Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> shows the scaling behaviour for this experiment, indicating that xLSTM will also perform favorably for larger models.</p><p>Ablation Studies.</p><p>Table 1 and Figure 6 demonstrate that xLSTM achieves excellent results at language modeling when being trained on 15B tokens from SlimPajama. To ablate the changes from LSTM to xLSTM, we morph a vanilla LSTM architecture step-by-step into an xLSTM architecture. Firstly, we integrate LSTM layers into pre-LayerNorm residual backbones. Secondly, we extend this to a post up-projection block. Finally, we add exponential gating and matrix memory. The results are shown in Table 2 (top). The ablation studies attribute the strong performance improvement to both the exponential gating and the matrix memory. Additionally, due to the importance of gating in RNNs and State Space Models, we ablate different gating mechanisms. In Table 2 (bottom), we conclude that having each gate learnable and influenced by the input has an incremental positive effect. Additional studies on the individual backbone components are discussed in Appendix B.2. 15B Tokens Figure 6: Method comparison on next token prediction when trained on 15B tokens from SlimPajama. Performance measure in validation perplexity for the best methods of each model class (see Table 1) are reported. The performance degradation of xLSTM[7:1] at 2.7B is due to initially slower training convergence that leads to an especially undertrained model. xLSTM is the best method at all sizes.

Fourthly, we assess the power-law scaling behavior, which allows to extrapolate the performance to larger model sizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Kaplan et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brown et al., 2020)</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref> presents the scaling behavior. All models share a similar scaling behavior but with different offsets. RWKV-4 performs worst, followed by Llama and Mamba. xLSTM is better than Mamba with a similar margin to Mamba as Mamba has to Llama. The scaling behavior indicates that for larger models xLSTM will continue to perform favourable compared to Transformers and State-Space models. 0.2 0.4 1.0 1.4 Number of Parameters ×10 9 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Validation Perplexity Llama Mamba RWKV-4 xLSTM[7:1] xLSTM[1:0] 300B Tokens Figure 8: Scaling laws.

Best models for each model class, see Table 1, were selected. The scaling laws indicate that for larger models xLSTM will perform well too.</p><p>Generation Times and Maximal Throughput. Finally, we measure the text generation time in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">9</ref> and the maximal throughput in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">9</ref> (left) for our xLSTM variants at 1.3B scale. We compare against similar sized Mamba, Llama and RWKV implementions from HuggingFace, including a static key-value cache for the Llama model. At the time of the experiments, both full cache compilation of the Transformer Model and compilation of the Mamba model with torch.compile did not work. For the text generation experiments all of the models are tested at batch size 1 and pre-fill 16. This pre-fill should be maximally favorable for the Transformer. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">9</ref> shows the linear scaling of the xLSTM and the other recurrent models Mamba and RWKV-4 compared to the quadratic scaling of Llama. For the decoding throughput we measure different batch sizes and prefill for the Llama model. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">9</ref> (right) shows that xLSTM can use much higher batch sizes than Llama due to its constant memory and thus achieves the highest throughput. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Limitations</head><p>(i) In contrast to mLSTM, memory mixing of the sLSTM prohibits parallelizable operations, and therefore does not allow a fast parallel implementation. Nevertheless, we developed a fast CUDA kernel for sLSTM, which is currently less than two times slower than our parallel mLSTM implementation. (ii) The CUDA kernels for mLSTM are not optimized, and therefore the current implementation is about 4 times slower than FlashAttention or the scan used in Mamba. Faster CUDA kernels could be obtained in the vein of FlashAttention. (iii) The matrix memory of mLSTM has high computation complexity since d × d matrices must be processed. Still, the memory update and retrieval does not use parameters and can be parallelized using standard matrix operations, therefore the wall clock time overhead due to the complex memory is minor. (iv) The initialization of the forget gates must be chosen carefully. (v) Since the matrix memory is independent of the sequence length, increasing the sequence length might overload the memory for longer context sizes. Still, this does not appear to be a limitation for contexts up to 16k, see Section 4.3. (vi) Due to the expensive computational load for large language experiments, we did neither fully optimize the architecture nor the hyperparameters, especially for larger xLSTM architectures. We anticipate that an extensive optimization process is needed for xLSTM to reach its full potential.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We have partly answered our simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTM to billions of parameters</p><p>? So far, we can answer: "At least as far as current technologies like Transformers or State Space Models". We have enhanced LSTM to xLSTM by exponential gating with memory mixing and a new memory structure. xLSTM models perform favorably on language modeling when compared to state-of-the-art methods like Transformers and State Space Models. The scaling laws indicate that larger xLSTM models will be serious competitors to current Large Language Models that are built with the Transformer technology. xLSTM has the potential to considerably impact other fields like Reinforcement Learning, Time Series Prediction, or the modeling of physical systems.</p></div>

This parameter efficient formulation of cell interactions together with the exponential gating is called the new memory mixing. Finally, to stabilize the backward pass, we clip the magnitude of δ R ht to 10, as a means to prohibit exploding gradients for long context lengths.</p><p>Proof of Equivalence for sLSTM Stabilized Version. The stabilization state m, see Equation (15) in the main paper, has no gradient, and hence does not influence the other gradients. We go back to the scalar version (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">8</ref>) here for simplicity. We re-define c (s) t and n (s) t as stabilized cell and normalizer states:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">c t = c (s) t exp m t (52) n t = n (s) t exp m t<label>(53)</label></formula><p>Inserting Equation <ref type="formula">15</ref>into Equation 8 yields:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">h(s) t = c (s) t /n (s) t = (54) = exp log (f t ) + m t-1 -m t c (s) t-1 + exp log (i t ) -m t z t exp log (f t ) + m t-1 -m t n (s) t-1 + exp log (i t ) -m t (55) = exp log (f t ) + m t-1 c (s) t-1 + exp (log (i t )) z t exp log (f t ) + m t-1 n (s) t-1 + exp (log (i t )) (56) = exp (log (f t )) c t-1 + exp (log (i t )) z t exp (log (f t )) n t-1 + exp (log (i t )) (57) = f t c t-1 + i t z t f t n t-1 + i t = c t /n t = ht<label>(58)</label></formula><p>Therefore, since the loss solely depends on h t , there's no dependency on m t , and consequently, no gradient exists for this stabilization state. Note that m t can be chosen arbitrarily. We choose m t = max (log (f t ) + m t-1 , log (i t )), which stabilizes the exponential function. One can even find m t , such that the normalizer state n t can be eliminated, but this version was experimentally found to be numerically unstable in the backward pass.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B Experiments</head><p>Training Setup. For all experiments, we use Python<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> 3.11 with PyTorch 2.2.0<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref> , and CUDA 12.1<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">foot_2</ref> on NVIDIA A100 GPUs. We developed and trained all our models and baselines over the course of three months on a cluster with 128 nodes of eight NVIDIA A100 GPUs each. More than 95% of this compute were used for the Language Modeling experiments in Sections 4.2 and 4.3.</p><p>Nearest Neighbor Search Task. For this auxiliary task, we use randomly sampled feature vectors of dimension 2 and unit norm. The attached value is a uniformly distributed random number from [0, 1], leading to inputs vectors of dimension 3. The first feature vector serves as search key, with the first value being ignored. Then the model has to predict the value of the nearest neighbor so far in the sequence. We train on 8192 sequences of context length up to 64 (uniformly sampled) and validate on 8192 different samples. All models have two blocks and embedding dimension 128. We use a dropout of 0.1, 10% linear warm-up steps and cosine decay to 1e-7 for 100k total training steps. We sweep over learning rates 1e-4, 1e-3, 1e-2, 1e-1 and 5 seeds each. The reported values in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">2</ref> are mean values for the best learning rate and 99% confidence intervals. Note that LSTM requires very high learning rates, whereas Transformers (Llama) perform best at the smallest learning rate. The xLSTM[0:1] reaches similar performance across all learning rates.</p><p>Wikitext-103 Rare Token Prediction. For this exemplary experiment on rare token prediction, we trained 125M-sized models on Wikitext-103 <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Merity et al., 2017)</ref>. All models have an embedding dimension of 768 in a post up-projection structure of 12 residual blocks. The Transformer model (Llama) uses Multi-Head Attention, for what is called LSTM the Multi-Head Attention is replaced by an LSTM and the xLSTM[1:0] contains mLSTM layers with matrix memory. Models were trained with maximum learning rate 1e-3, 4k steps linear warm-up and cosine decay for in total 50k steps, using a batch size of 256 and context length of 512. We use the validation perplexity as a stopping criterion and evaluate on the test set. We evaluate xLSTM on a suite of formal language tasks to test its exponential gating and memory mixing mechanism.</p><p>Formal languages provide a framework to probe the generalization capabilities of models. They allow to specifically test different expressivity levels, e.g. along the Chomsky hierarchy. Typical language model architectures do not necessarily fit perfectly in these hierarchies <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Delétang et al., 2023)</ref> nevertheless these languages allow to illustrate differences in generalization expressivity between different architectures. Our evaluation tasks are heavily based on the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Delétang et al. (2023)</ref>.</p><p>Experiment Setup. The different formal language tasks in the experiment (see individual tasks description below) encompass different levels of the Chomsky hierarchy as well as additional counting and memory-focused tasks. We use different lengths per sample, which allows us to validate in a length extrapolation setting. We train on a varying task length up to 40. The evaluation is done for task lengths between 40 and 256 as we are only interested in the "task generalization capabilities" of the models.</p><p>In all experiments, we use two blocks (or layers for the pure LSTM) for all models. We compare Llama, Mamba, Retention, Hyena, RWKV-4, RWKV-5, RWKV-6, LSTM, xLSTM[0:1], xLSTM[1:0] and xLSTM[1:1]. The sLSTM block is used without a convolution and with normal weight initialization. LSTM (Block) refers to an architecture where a vanilla LSTM is used instead of self-attention inside a Transformer block.</p><p>All models are trained with 3 different learning rates (1e-2, 1e-3, 1e-4), each with two seeds. Batch size is 256 -cosine annealing (min lr: 1e-5) with 10% warm-up steps is applied. We use AdamW <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Loshchilov &amp; Hutter, 2019)</ref> (β 1 = 0.9, β 2 = 0.99) and a weight decay of 0.1 for training.      In each experiment we train for 100k steps -the samples are generated randomly, however, all experiments are trained and evaluated on the same samples.</p><p>Additional Formal Language Results. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">12</ref> showcases supplementary results on formal language task, detailing tasks where no model attained a minimum scaled accuracy of 0.3. Although no model achieves proper extrapolation of the task to a larger context length, xLSTM performs best among the evaluated models.</p><p>Individual Task Description. The majority of tasks are based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Delétang et al. (2023)</ref>. We provide the vocabulary size |V | and the random accuracy s rand (for accuracy scaling), used in the evaluation. As we evaluate different task lengths each task has a padding token which is used to pad the sequence to the given context length. In Listing 1 there is an example for each task.</p><p>• Bucket Sort Given a string of tokens of a sorted alphabet, compute the sorted string.</p><p>|V | = 11 s rand = 1</p><p>|V |-1</p><p>• Cycle Nav Given a string of "movement tokens" (+1, -1, STAY) compute the end position of the agent with start position 0.

(2023)</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">13</ref> illustrates the basic task setup.</p><p>Why Multi-Query Associative Recall for Memory Tests of LLM Architectures. Associative Recall (AR), the ability to retrieve a specific value (information) associated with a given key (information), constitutes a key capability for LLM to perform well <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Poli et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Arora et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Olsson et al., 2022)</ref>. Especially its quality of in-context learning seems to be strongly connected to this capability <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Olsson et al., 2022)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Arora et al. (2023)</ref> attribute performance gaps between early non-Transformer and Transformer language models specifically to performance gaps in associative recall. They argue that prior AR evaluations fall short of capturing these differences and propose MQAR, which can show the AR performance differences that translate to performance differences in language modeling performance. Hence, MQAR is especially suitable to analyze the memory capacity of LLM. Transformer (e.g. Llama) models can be seen as the gold standard for this task as their memory is exponential in the coding dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Ramsauer et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Experiment Setup. There are two relevant variables that determine different experimental setups.</p><p>( In all experiments, we use two blocks (or layers for the pure LSTM) for all models. LSTM (Block) model refers to an architecture where a vanilla LSTM is used instead of self-attention inside a Transformer block.</p><p>For each task setup, we train each model with 4 different learning rates (batch size &gt; 24: {1e-2, 2.15e-3, 4.6e-4, 1e-4}, batch size 24: {1e-3, 2.2e-4, 5e-5, 1e-5}). The batch size (BS) changes depending on the context length (CL) (CL=64/128: BS=512; CL=256: BS=256; CL=756: BS=128; CL=1024: BS=96; CL=2048: BS=24). We vary the embedding dimension (Model Dim) between different experiments -different numbers of heads are used accordingly. For each experiment, we generate 100,000 training samples (validation: 3,000 samples) and train for 64 epochs. We apply cosine annealing (min lr: 1e-4 and 1e-5) with 10% warm-up steps. We use AdamW <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Loshchilov &amp; Hutter, 2019)</ref> and a weight decay of 0.1 for training.</p><p>We conduct three different experiments:</p><p>• MQAR-Experiment 1 evaluates, in the same fashion as</p><p>Arora et al. (2023), a variety of models (Llama, Mamba, Mamba (noWT) -i.e. without weight tying, Retention, Hyena, H3, RWKV-4, RWKV-5, RWKV-6, LSTM, LSTM (Block), xLSTM[0:1], xLSTM[1:0] and xLSTM[1:1]) on increasing task difficulty by increasing the context length and number of key-value pairs simultaneously. We benchmark three parameter settings: CL,KV={(64,4),(128,8),(256,16)}. • MQAR-Experiment 2 increases the task difficulty notably and goes beyond previous evaluations on this task. We individually scale the context length (CL={756, 1024, 2048}) and the key-value pairs (KV={48, 96, 256}) and evaluate all combinations. This experiment especially probes the memory capacity because the number of key-value pairs is high.</p><p>To reduce the computational burden we only evaluate models that perform flawlessly in Experiment 1 -additionally we evaluate Transformer only in the hardest setting (CL=2048) as sanity check, because no performance decrease is expected. • MQAR-Experiment 3 analyzes whether the AR capability learned on a certain context length extrapolates to bigger context lengths. For each KV setting of Experiment 2, we use the models (we select the 3 biggest model dimensions) trained on CL=2048 and evaluate bigger context lengths (CL={4096, 6144, 8192}).</p><p>Extended Results. The result of Experiment 1 can be found in The results of Experiment 2 are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">15</ref>. Scaling the context length has a low impact on the performance of the models. However, while xLSTM[1:1] and xLSTM[1:0] show no clear decay, both RWKV variants slightly, but consistently lose performance with increasing context lengths. The varying number of key-value pairs, which mainly probes the memory capacity of the non-Transformer models, has a more notable impact across all models. RWKV-5 seems to outperform RWKV-6. The latter fails to learn the task at all in some KV=256 settings. Overall xLSTM[1:1] is the best-performing non-Transformer model -suggesting that it provides enhanced memory capacity, also in long contexts. We assess the performance of xLSTM across tasks in the Long Range Arena benchmark <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Tay et al., 2021)</ref>, examining its ability to effectively handle longer context lengths and diverse data types.</p><p>Our experiments on Long Range Arena benchmark are composed of five tasks:</p><p>• Retrieval: The task is to predict if two documents have a citation link. The dataset of text documents is derived from the ACL Anthology Network <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Radev et al., 2009)</ref>. • ListOps: This is a set of modular arithmetic tasks including brackets and lists of numbers, using the operations MIN, MAX, MEDIAN and SUMMOD (modular sum). A particular example is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_73">[MAX 4 3 [MIN 2 3 ] 1 0 [MEDIAN 1 5 8 9, 2]] - →<label>5</label></formula><p>• Image: This task is based on a version of the CIFAR dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Krizhevsky, 2009)</ref>, where images are transformed to a sequence of pixels and this sequence has to be classified into the usual CIFAR classes. We test both a gray-scale (G-Image) and RGB (RGB-Image) version of this dataset, as <ref type="bibr">Orvieto et al. (2023)</ref> uses colored images contrary to the standard setup. • Pathfinder: The input for this task is a 32x32 gray-scale image, given as pixel sequence, with two dots and several curved lines on it. The task is to predict if the two dots are connected by any of the lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Linsley et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>We omit the Text classification task <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Maas et al., 2011)</ref>, as the language modeling experiments already test this kind of data, and the Pathfinder-X version of Pathfinder.</p><p>Experiment Setup. The architectures that are tested in this experiment comprise Llama, Mamba, LSTM, RWKV-4, and xLSTM. LSTM (Block) refers to an architecture where a vanilla LSTM is used inside a post up-projection block (like Transformer with attention replaced by LSTM). For xLSTM we choose the best performing of xLSTM[0:1] or xLSTM[1:0] on the validation set, specifically the former for the Image tasks and the latter for all other ones.</p><p>We use the hyperparameter settings of the S5 model <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Smith et al., 2022)</ref> and Linear Recurrent Unit model <ref type="bibr">(Orvieto et al., 2023)</ref>, with additional hyperparamter search on learning rates and schedulers for all models. We use two different schedulers: Linear Warm-up Cosine Annealing and Linear Warm-up Cosine Annealing with Restarts. Both learning rate schedulers were evaluated with learning rates of 1e-3, 6e-4 and 1e-4. For the second scheduler, the number of restarts (R) is set to 3. The model hyperparameters for each dataset are displayed in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>.</p><p>Results. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">6</ref> shows the result of experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark. xLSTM demonstrates consistent strong performance on all of the tasks, suggesting that the proposed architecture is remarkably efficient in handling different aspects of long context problems.  General Training Procedure. We tokenize our datasets using the HuggingFace GPT-2 tokenizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Radford et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brown et al., 2020)</ref> <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">foot_4</ref> and use this tokenizer for all models in this paper. In general, we try to follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brown et al. (2020)</ref> for the general training setup, i.e. we choose context length 2048 and batch sizes 256 or 512 for our models. We use the AdamW <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Loshchilov &amp; Hutter, 2019)</ref> optimizer with beta parameters (β 1 , β 2 )=(0.9, 0.95) and an epsilon parameter of 1e-5. As learning rate scheduler we use a linear warm-up with 750 steps and cosine decay to 10% of the peak learning rate. We apply a weight decay of 0.1 to all our models and always exclude the token embedding matrix from weight decay. If not specified otherwise, we do not tie the weights of the token embedding and the language model head. For parallelization, we use PyTorch FSDP in SHARD_GRAD_OP mode with mixed precision in bfloat16, where applicable. For small models we use NO_SHARD. We keep the weights in float32 and reduce the gradients across GPUs in float32.</p><p>We use torch.compile to speed up models, except for Transformer models as their training curves did not match the non-compiled versions. For xLSTM[7:1], we use positions <ref type="bibr">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">7,</ref><ref type="bibr">40,</ref><ref type="bibr">42,</ref><ref type="bibr">44]</ref> for sLSTM-based blocks, except for the 125M size, where we use <ref type="bibr">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr">20]</ref> (this is actually a [11:1] ratio).</p><p>We do not use any positional encoding for our xLSTM models.</p><p>Details on Comparison to Other Methods. For the model comparison on 15B training tokens of SlimPajama we train all models with context length 2048 and batch size 256. We use a peak learning rate of 1e-3 for all models for comparability. The learning rate decays over 30k training steps. The models are compared after one epoch at training step 28170. As model implementations we use the original repositories' code for Mamba <ref type="bibr">(Gu &amp; Dao, 2023)</ref> <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">foot_5</ref> , RWKV-5, RWKV-6 (Peng  et al., 2024) 7 . For RWKV-4 we use a cleaned and validated re-implementation based on the original repo and kernels <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Peng et al., 2023)</ref>. In our RWKV-4 implementation we enable weight decay on all parameters except biases, the token embedding weight and all LayerNorm weights. For HGRN <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Qin et al., 2023)</ref>, GLA <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(Yang et al., 2023)</ref>, HGRN2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Qin et al., 2024)</ref> we use the a re-implementation flash-linear-attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Yang &amp; Zhang, 2024)</ref> by the authors of GLA <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(Yang et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Yang &amp; Zhang, 2024)</ref> <ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">foot_7</ref> . For GPT-3 and Llama-like Transformers, we use our own implementations based on PyTorch. Note that for all xLSTMs, Transformers, Mamba and RWKV-4, we use Mixed Precision training with bfloat16 and weights in float32 precision. Following the general training procedure we use torch.compile for all models, except for Transformers and models using the flash-linear-attention library because of compilation problems.</p><p>As RWKV-6 performs worse than RWKV-5, we also train a model with peak learning rate 4e-4, as reported in the original repository for 350M parameter models <ref type="foot" target="#foot_8">9</ref> . This model reaches a perplexity of 16.38, worse than the 15.03 for the standard peak learning rate 1e-3 as reported in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Similarly, we tested the repository learning rates for other model sizes and all performed worse than the ones we also use for xLSTM (see Table <ref type="table">7</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Details on Training Precision for Baselines.</head><p>For models from flash-linear-attention and RWKV-5/6 models we found that PyTorch automatic mixed precision training did not work, but casting the model weights to float32 initially with FSDP parameter precision bfloat16 led to a working configuration. In this setting, models perform better than in full bfloat16 training, where the weights are casted to bfloat16 initially as well. Full float32 training did not work because of the custom kernels that require bfloat16.</p><p>General Details on Ablation Studies. We follow our general training procedure and train all models with context length 2048, batch size 256 and peak learning rate 1e-3. We report perplexity values on the validation set.</p><p>Additional Ablation Study on Matrix Memory. As default block configuration we use the mLSTM in the pre up-projection block (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">11</ref>) and the sLSTM in the post up-projection block (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">10</ref>). In this experiment we study combination of mLSTM with different block variants using the xLSTM[1:0] architecture. We compare the mLSTM in a post up-projection block (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref> and 10) with ReLU 2 activation function and non-gated feed-forward network to mLSTM in a pre up-projection block with and without a dimension-wise causal convolution. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">8</ref> shows that the matrix memory benefits from the pre up-projection block structure, and that the convolution within this block is important.  <ref type="bibr">Vaswani et al.)</ref>, which corresponds to the post up-projection backbone (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>) further boosts performance. Adding Exponential Gating to this architecture yields the sLSTM as depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">10</ref>, with another large performance improvement. Finally, adding the best Matrix Memory variant found in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">8</ref> by replacing some sLSTM blocks with the mLSTM (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">11</ref>) gives xLSTM[7:1] with the best performance.</p><p>Details on Gating Technique Ablation Study.

The recurrent models (xLSTM[1:0], xLSTM[7:1], Mamba and RWKV-4) show linear behavior, whereas the Transformer (Llama) inference/decoding time is quadratic in sequence length. Right: Token throughput for different batch sizes on a A100-80GB GPU for 1.3B sized models. Note that the Transformer / Llama model goes out of memory (OOM) already for small batch sizes, whereas xLSTM and Mamba can sustain very large batch sizes. xLSTM[1:0] consistently outperforms Mamba in throughput.</figDesc></figure>

The mLSTM cell input is dimension-wise causally convoluted (kernel size 4), before entering a learnable skip connection. We obtain input q and k via block-diagonal projection matrices of block size 4. The values v are fed directly, skipping the convolution part. After the mLSTM sequence mixing, outputs are normalized via GroupNorm<ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Wu &amp; He, 2018</ref>) -a head-wise layer norm for each of the four heads. Finally, the learnable skip input is added and the result is gated component-wise with the external output gate. The output is down-projected.</figDesc></figure>

The comparison of xLSTM[0:1] with both original LSTM variants indicates that the exponential gating mechanism improves the AR capabilities of the model. However, both fall short because of the reduced memory capacity compared to xLSTM[1:1] and xLSTM[1:0].</figDesc></figure>
