- **LSTM Overview**: Introduced in the 1990s to address vanishing gradient issues in RNNs using constant error carousel and gating mechanisms.
  
- **Key Equations**:
  - Cell state update: \( c_t = f_t c_{t-1} + i_t z_t \)
  - Hidden state output: \( h_t = o_t \psi(c_t) \)
  
- **Limitations of LSTMs**:
  1. Inability to revise storage decisions (e.g., Nearest Neighbor Search).
  2. Limited storage capacities (e.g., struggles with rare token prediction).
  3. Lack of parallelizability due to memory mixing.

- **xLSTM Introduction**: Combines exponential gating and modified memory structures to enhance LSTM capabilities.
  
- **sLSTM Features**:
  - Scalar memory and update with new memory mixing.
  - Exponential gating for input and forget gates.
  - Forward pass equations:
    - \( c_t = f_t c_{t-1} + i_t z_t \)
    - \( n_t = f_t n_{t-1} + i_t \) (normalizer state)
    - \( h_t = o_t h_t, h_t = \frac{c_t}{n_t} \)

- **mLSTM Features**:
  - Matrix memory \( C_t \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d} \) for enhanced storage.
  - Covariance update rule for key-value pairs:
    - \( C_t = C_{t-1} + v_t k_t^T \)
  - Forward pass equations:
    - \( C_t = f_t C_{t-1} + i_t v_t k_t^T \)
    - \( n_t = f_t n_{t-1} + i_t k_t \)
    - \( h_t = o_t \odot h_t, h_t = \frac{C_t q_t}{\max(n_t^T q_t, 1)} \)

- **Exponential Gating**: Stabilization techniques to prevent overflow in gate activations, using a stabilizer state \( m_t \).

- **Memory Mixing in sLSTM**: Allows multiple memory cells with mixing across cells, but not across heads.

- **Architecture**: xLSTM blocks are formed by integrating sLSTM and mLSTM into residual block modules, leading to xLSTM architectures.

- **Performance Comparison**: xLSTM shows favorable performance against state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models in language modeling tasks.
