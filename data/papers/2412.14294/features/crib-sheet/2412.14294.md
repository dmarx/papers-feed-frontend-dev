- **TRecViT Overview**: A hybrid architecture combining gated linear recurrent units (LRUs) for temporal processing and Vision Transformer (ViT) blocks for spatial processing, designed for efficient video understanding.

- **Architecture Components**:
  - **Gated Linear Recurrent Units (LRUs)**: Handle temporal mixing with O(N) complexity during training and O(1) during inference.
  - **ViT Blocks**: Perform spatial mixing via self-attention and channel mixing via MLP.

- **Key Equations for Gated LRUs**:
  - Input gate: \( i_t = \sigma(W_x x_t + b_x) \)
  - Recurrence gate: \( r_t = \sigma(W_\lambda x_t + b_\lambda) \)
  - State update: 
    \[
    h_t = \lambda_t \odot h_{t-1} + (1 - \lambda_t) \odot (i_t \odot x_t)
    \]
  - Where \( \lambda_t \) contains eigenvalues of the recurrence matrix, ensuring stability and controlling information decay.

- **Positional Encoding**: Spatial positional encoding is added to token embeddings to maintain spatial information.

- **Efficiency**: TRecViT achieves a lower memory footprint and fewer FLOPs compared to traditional transformers by using LRUs for temporal processing and self-attention for spatial processing.

- **Training Regimes**: Supports both supervised and self-supervised training, including masked auto-encoding (MAE).

- **Causal Setup**: The model respects the "arrow of time," making it suitable for real-time applications like robotics.

- **Comparison with Other Models**: TRecViT outperforms existing video transformer models (e.g., ViViT) and pure SSM models in terms of efficiency and performance on temporal dynamics.

- **Applications**: Versatile for various video understanding tasks, including video classification and point tracking.

- **Limitations and Future Work**: Discussed in Section 6, highlighting areas for improvement and exploration in future research.
