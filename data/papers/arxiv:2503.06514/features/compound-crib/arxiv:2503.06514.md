## GFlowVLM Overview

GFlowVLM is a novel framework designed to enhance the capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by integrating Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) for fine-tuning. The primary goal of GFlowVLM is to improve multi-step reasoning and promote the generation of diverse solutions in complex tasks. This is particularly important in scenarios where traditional methods struggle, such as in embodied AI and other sequential decision-making tasks that require a nuanced understanding of context and causality.

### Key Limitations of Existing Methods

1. **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**:
   - **Assumption of IID Data**: SFT typically relies on the assumption that training data is independent and identically distributed (IID). This can lead to overfitting on the training set and poor generalization to unseen scenarios, as the model may not learn to handle variations in data effectively.
   - **Limited Solution Diversity**: By focusing on maximizing the likelihood of the training data, SFT often results in a narrow solution space, limiting the model's ability to explore alternative strategies or solutions.

2. **Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**:
   - **Focus on Cumulative Rewards**: PPO and similar RL methods prioritize maximizing cumulative rewards, which can lead to short-sighted decision-making. This focus on immediate rewards often neglects the importance of long-term dependencies and the broader context of the task.
   - **Limited Exploration**: The reward structure in RL can constrain exploration, causing the model to converge on suboptimal policies that do not consider the full range of possible actions and their consequences.

### Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets)

GFlowNets offer a solution to the limitations of SFT and PPO by enabling the training of stochastic policies that can sample diverse, high-reward sequences. Key features include:

- **Stochastic Policy Training**: GFlowNets learn to sample from a distribution of trajectories, allowing for a broader exploration of potential solutions.
- **Non-Markovian Decision Process**: By modeling the environment as a non-Markovian process, GFlowNets can capture long-term dependencies, which are crucial for complex reasoning tasks.
- **Reward Proportional Sampling**: The probability of sampling a terminal state \( x \) is directly proportional to the reward function \( R(x) \), ensuring that higher-reward solutions are more likely to be sampled.

### Mathematical Formulation

The framework utilizes a trajectory flow \( F: T \to \mathbb{R}^+ \) defined over trajectories \( \tau \). The forward and backward policies are mathematically represented as follows:

- **Forward Policy**:
  \[
  P_F(\tau) = P_F(s_0 \to \ldots \to s_n) = \prod_{t=0}^{n-1} P_F(s_{t+1}|s_t)
  \]

- **Backward Policy**:
  \[
  P_B(\tau) = P_B(s_n \to \ldots \to s_0) = \prod_{t=0}^{n-1} P_B(s_t|s_{t+1})
  \]

This formulation allows GFlowNets to effectively model the flow of information and decisions over time, capturing the dependencies necessary for complex reasoning.

### Non-Markovian Approach

The non-Markovian approach is critical for tasks that require consideration of historical actions and states. By incorporating this historical context, GFlowVLM can make more informed decisions, which is essential for tasks that involve multi-step reasoning and planning.

### Empirical Results

GFlowVLM has demonstrated superior performance compared to SFT and PPO in various tasks, such as card games and embodied planning. For instance, in a numerical sequence prediction task, GFlowVLM achieved a 76.4% success rate, outperforming PPO by 26%. This improvement is attributed to GFlowNets' ability to explore diverse reasoning paths and generate a wider range of solutions.

### Prompt Design

The input to GFlowVLM includes the current observation \( o_t \) and a task-specific prompt \( p_t \), which contains the goal description, history of actions, and states. The outputs consist of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning \( c_t \) and the selected action \( a_t \). This structured input-output design facilitates effective reasoning and decision-making.

### Training Efficiency

GFlowNets leverage off-policy training data, which enhances sample efficiency and accelerates convergence compared to traditional on-policy methods. This ability to utilize past experiences allows GFlowVLM to learn more effectively from diverse data sources.
