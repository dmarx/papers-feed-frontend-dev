  "abstract": "Flow Matching (FM) is a recent framework for generative modeling that has\nachieved state-of-the-art performance across various domains, including image,\nvideo, audio, speech, and biological structures. This guide offers a\ncomprehensive and self-contained review of FM, covering its mathematical\nfoundations, design choices, and extensions. By also providing a PyTorch\npackage featuring relevant examples (e.g., image and text generation), this\nwork aims to serve as a resource for both novice and experienced researchers\ninterested in understanding, applying and further developing FM.",
