- **Flow Matching (FM) Overview**: A generative modeling framework achieving state-of-the-art performance across various domains (image, video, audio, etc.).
  
- **Mathematical Foundation**: FM learns a velocity field \( u_t \) that defines a flow \( \psi_t \) via the ODE:
  \[
  \frac{d}{dt} \psi_t(x) = u_t(\psi_t(x)), \quad \psi_0(x) = x
  \]

- **Objective**: Transform a sample \( X_0 \sim p \) from a source distribution into \( X_1 = \psi_1(X_0) \sim q \) (target distribution).

- **Flow Matching Recipe**:
  1. Choose a probability path \( p_t \) interpolating between source \( p \) and target \( q \).
  2. Train a velocity field \( u_t \) to define the flow transformation.

- **Flow Matching Loss**:
  \[
  L_{FM}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{t,X_t} \left[ \| u^\theta_t(X_t) - u_t(X_t) \|^2 \right]
  \]

- **Conditional Flow Matching Loss**:
  \[
  L_{CFM}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{t,X_t,X_1} \left[ \| u^\theta_t(X_t) - u_t(X_t | X_1) \|^2 \right]
  \]

- **Key Extensions**:
  - **Discrete Flow Matching**: Adapts FM for Continuous Time Markov Chains (CTMC).
  - **Riemannian Flow Matching**: Extends FM to Riemannian manifolds, applicable in chemistry (e.g., protein folding).
  - **Generator Matching**: Unifies various generative models under the FM framework.

- **Diffusion Models**: First to implement simulation-free training of CTMP processes, using SDEs to model forward noising processes.

- **Probability Path Construction**: For a Gaussian source distribution \( p_0 = N(x|0, I) \):
  \[
  p_t(x) = \int p_{t|1}(x|x_1) q(x_1) dx_1
  \]
  where \( p_{t|1}(x|x_1) = N(x|tx_1, (1-t)^2 I) \).

- **Sampling from Target Distribution**: Generate new samples by solving the ODE defined by the velocity field after drawing from the source distribution.

  - **Figure 2**: Depicts the flow construction and training process.

- **Implementation**: A PyTorch package is provided for practical application of FM, including examples for image and text generation.

- **Applications**: FM has been successfully applied in diverse fields, including robotics, audio generation, and biological structure modeling.
