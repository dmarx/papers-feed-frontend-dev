  "abstract": "Recent trend towards increasing large machine learning models require both\ntraining and inference tasks to be distributed. Considering the huge cost of\ntraining these models, it is imperative to unlock optimizations in computation\nand communication to obtain best performance. However, current logical\nseparation between computation and communication kernels in deep learning\nframeworks misses the optimization opportunities across such barrier. Breaking\nthis abstraction with a holistic consideration can provide many optimizations\nto provide performance improvements in distributed workloads. Manually applying\nthese optimizations needs modifications in underlying computation and\ncommunication libraries for each scenario, which is time consuming and\nerror-prone.\n  Therefore, we present CoCoNeT, with a DSL to express a program with both\ncomputation and communication. CoCoNeT contains several machine learning aware\ntransformations to optimize a program and a compiler to generate high\nperformance kernels. Providing both computation and communication as first\nclass constructs allows users to work on a high-level abstraction and apply\npowerful optimizations, such as fusion or overlapping of communication and\ncomputation. CoCoNeT enables us to optimize data-, model-and pipeline-parallel\nworkloads in large language models with only a few lines of code. Experiments\nshow CoCoNeT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art distributed machine\nlearning implementations.",
