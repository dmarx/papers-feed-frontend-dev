  "title": "SVCCA: Singular Vector Canonical Correlation Analysis for Deep Learning\n  Dynamics and Interpretability",
  "authors": "Maithra Raghu, Justin Gilmer, Jason Yosinski, Jascha Sohl-Dickstein",
  "abstract": "We propose a new technique, Singular Vector Canonical Correlation Analysis\n(SVCCA), a tool for quickly comparing two representations in a way that is both\ninvariant to affine transform (allowing comparison between different layers and\nnetworks) and fast to compute (allowing more comparisons to be calculated than\nwith previous methods). We deploy this tool to measure the intrinsic\ndimensionality of layers, showing in some cases needless over-parameterization;\nto probe learning dynamics throughout training, finding that networks converge\nto final representations from the bottom up; to show where class-specific\ninformation in networks is formed; and to suggest new training regimes that\nsimultaneously save computation and overfit less.
