## Detailed Technical Explanations and Justifications for Research Decisions

### Glaze Mechanism

The Glaze mechanism is designed to protect artwork from AI mimicry by introducing perturbations that confuse diffusion models. The rationale behind this approach is rooted in the understanding of how diffusion models operate, particularly in their reliance on latent representations of images.

#### Optimization Objective

The optimization problem for Glaze is formulated as:

\[
\min_{\delta_x} ||E(x + \delta_x) - E(\Omega(x, T))||^2
\]

**Justification:**
- **Latent Space Manipulation**: The goal is to ensure that the perturbed image \(x + \delta_x\) has a latent representation \(E(x + \delta_x)\) that closely resembles the latent representation of a style-transferred version of the original artwork \(E(\Omega(x, T))\). This effectively misleads the diffusion model into interpreting the artwork as belonging to a different style.
- **Confusion of the Model**: By optimizing the perturbation \(\delta_x\), the mechanism aims to create a significant deviation in the model's understanding of the artwork's style, thereby reducing the likelihood of successful mimicry.

#### Constraints

The optimization is subject to the constraint:

\[
LPIPS(x + \delta_x, x) < p_G
\]

**Justification:**
- **Perceptual Similarity**: The LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity) metric is employed to ensure that the perturbation does not significantly alter the visual quality of the artwork. This constraint allows the perturbation to be effective in confusing the model while maintaining the integrity of the original artwork as perceived by human observers.
- **Controlled Distortion**: By bounding the perturbation, the mechanism ensures that the artwork remains recognizable and retains its artistic value, which is crucial for protecting the rights of the artist.

### IM-PRESS Overview

IM-PRESS is a purification method that aims to recover the original representation of artwork after it has been Glazed. The method introduces additional perturbations to the Glazed images.

#### Optimization Objective

The optimization problem for IM-PRESS is formulated as:

\[
\min_{\delta_{pur}} ||(x_{glazed} + \delta_{pur}) - VAE(x_{glazed} + \delta_{pur})||^2_2
\]

**Justification:**
- **Restoration of Original Representation**: The goal is to minimize the difference between the perturbed Glazed image and its reconstruction from a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). This approach assumes that the VAE can effectively capture the latent representation of the original artwork, thus guiding the purification process.
- **Latent Space Recovery**: By optimizing the perturbation \(\delta_{pur}\), the method seeks to navigate back to the original latent space of the non-Glazed image, effectively reversing the effects of the Glaze mechanism.

#### Constraints

The optimization is subject to the constraint:

\[
LPIPS(x_{glazed} + \delta_{pur}, x_{glazed}) < p_I
\]

**Justification:**
- **Preservation of Glazed Quality**: Similar to the Glaze mechanism, this constraint ensures that the purification process does not introduce excessive distortion to the Glazed image, maintaining a balance between recovery and perceptual quality.

### Key Limitations of IM-PRESS

1. **Limited Effectiveness on Non-Historical Artists**: The method shows weaker performance on contemporary artists whose styles are not well-represented in the training data of diffusion models.
   - **Justification**: The reliance on pretrained models means that if an artist's style is not sufficiently embedded in the model, the purification process will struggle to recover the original representation.

2. **Poor Performance on Smooth Surface Art Styles**: The method encounters challenges with art styles characterized by smooth surfaces, such as realism.
   - **Justification**: The optimization process requires precise adjustments to recover the original smooth textures, which can be difficult to achieve when the initial perturbations have significantly altered the image.

3. **Degradation of Image Quality**: The purification process can lead to a loss of texture and overall image quality.
   - **Justification**: The introduction of additional perturbations may inadvertently smooth out important details, resulting in a less faithful representation of the original artwork.

### Evaluation Metrics

The evaluation of mimicry success is complicated by the limitations of existing metrics.

1. **CLIP-based Metrics**: While CLIP genre accuracy has been used to assess mimicry, it is found to be unreliable due to its insensitivity to image quality degradation.
   - **Justification**: The metric may classify low-quality images as successful mimics, failing to capture the essence of what constitutes effective mimicry in artistic terms.

2. **FrÃ©chet Inception Distance (FID)**: This metric has also been shown to be erroneous for evaluating generative models.
   - **Justification**: F
