- **Glaze Mechanism**: Protects artwork from AI mimicry by adding perturbations to confuse diffusion models. 
  - Optimization: 
    - Minimize \( ||E(x + \delta_x) - E(\Omega(x, T))||^2 \) 
    - Subject to \( LPIPS(x + \delta_x, x) < p_G \)

- **IM-PRESS Overview**: A purification method that adds perturbations to Glazed images to recover original artwork representation.
  - Optimization: 
    - Minimize \( ||(x_{glazed} + \delta_{pur}) - VAE(x_{glazed} + \delta_{pur})||^2_2 \) 
    - Subject to \( LPIPS(x_{glazed} + \delta_{pur}, x_{glazed}) < p_I \)

- **Key Limitations of IMPRESS**:
  - Limited effectiveness on non-historical artists.
  - Poor performance on smooth surface art styles (e.g., realism).
  - Degradation of image quality for clean images.

- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - CLIP-based metrics (e.g., CLIP genre accuracy) are unreliable for assessing mimicry success due to their insensitivity to image quality degradation.
  - FrÃ©chet Inception Distance (FID) also shown to be erroneous for generative model evaluation.

- **Real-World Implications**:
  - Current artists are more affected by AI mimicry than historical artists.
  - Legal implications under Section 1201 of the DMCA regarding the circumvention of technological protection measures like Glaze.

- **Mimicry Results**:
  - Significant artifacts introduced in mimicry results when using purified Glazed images.
  - Purification challenges with smooth surface art styles, leading to poor recovery of original representations.

- **Future Directions**:
  - Need for automated metrics that accurately reflect human judgment in art mimicry evaluation.
  - Exploration of legal questions surrounding the use of Glaze and copyright implications.
