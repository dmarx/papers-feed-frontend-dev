<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Dimension reduction plays an important role in data science, being a fundamental technique in both visualisation and as pre-processing for machine 1 learning. Dimension reduction techniques are being applied in a broadening range of elds and on ever increasing sizes of datasets. It is thus desirable to have an algorithm that is both scalable to massive data and able to cope with the diversity of data available. Dimension reduction algorithms tend to fall into two categories; those that seek to preserve the pairwise distance structure amongst all the data samples and those that favor the preservation of local distances over global distance. Algorithms such as PCA <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, MDS <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, and Sammon mapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> fall into the former category while t-SNE <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">58]</ref>, Isomap <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56]</ref>, LargeVis <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, Laplacian eigenmaps <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref> and di usion maps <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> all fall into the la er category.</p><p>In this paper we introduce a novel manifold learning technique for dimension reduction. We provide a sound mathematical theory grounding the technique and a practical scalable algorithm that applies to real world data. UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) builds upon mathematical foundations related to the work of Belkin and Niyogi on Laplacian eigenmaps. We seek to address the issue of uniform data distributions on manifolds through a combination of Riemannian geometry and the work of David Spivak <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> in category theoretic approaches to geometric realization of fuzzy simplicial sets. t-SNE is the current state-of-the-art for dimension reduction for visualization. Our algorithm is competitive with t-SNE for visualization quality and arguably preserves more of the global structure with superior run time performance. Furthermore the algorithm is able to scale to signi cantly larger data set sizes than are feasible for t-SNE. Finally, UMAP has no computational restrictions on embedding dimension, making it viable as a general purpose dimension reduction technique for machine learning.</p><p>Based upon preliminary releases of a so ware implementation, UMAP has already found widespread use in the elds of bioinformatics <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>, materials science <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>, and machine learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref> among others.</p><p>is paper is laid out as follows. In Section 2 we describe the theory underlying the algorithm. Section 2 is necessary to understand both the theory underlying why UMAP works and the motivation for the choices that where made in developing the algorithm. A reader without a background (or interest) in topological data analysis, category theory or the theoretical underpinnings of UMAP should skip over this section and proceed directly to Section 3.</p><p>at being said, we feel that strong theory and mathematically justi ed algorithmic decisions are of particular importance in the eld of unsupervised learning. is is, at least partially, due to plethora of proposed objec-tive functions within the area. We a empt to highlight in this paper that UMAPs design decisions were all grounded in a solid theoretic foundation and not derived through experimentation with any particular task focused objective function. ough all neighbourhood based manifold learning algorithms must share certain fundamental components we believe it to be advantageous for these components to be selected through well grounded theoretical decisions. One of the primary contributions of this paper is to reframe the problem of manifold learning and dimension reduction in a different mathematical language allowing pracitioners to apply a new eld of mathemtaics to the problems.</p><p>In Section 3 we provide a more computational description of UMAP. Section 3 should provide readers less familiar with topological data analysis with a be er foundation for understanding the theory described in Section 2. Appendix C contrasts UMAP against the more familiar algorithms t-SNE and LargeVis, describing all these algorithms in similar language. is section should assist readers already familiar with those techniques to quickly gain an understanding of the UMAP algorithm though they will grant li le insite into its theoretical underpinnings.</p><p>In Section 4 we discuss implementation details of the UMAP algorithm. is includes a more detailed algorithmic description, and discussion of the hyper-parameters involved and their practical e ects.</p><p>In Section 5 we provide practical results on real world datasets as well as scaling experiments to demonstrate the algorithm's performance in real world scenarios as compared with other dimension reduction algorithms.</p><p>In Section 6 we discuss relative weakenesses of the algorithm, and applications for which UMAP may not be the best choice.</p><p>Finally, in Section 7 we detail a number of potential extensions of UMAP that are made possible by its construction upon solid mathematical foundations.</p><p>ese avenues for further development include semi-supervised learning, metric learning and heterogeneous data embedding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">eoretical Foundations for UMAP</head><p>e theoretical foundations for UMAP are largely based in manifold theory and topological data analysis. Much of the theory is most easily explained in the language of topology and category theory. Readers may consult <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> for background. Readers more interested in practical computational aspects of the algorithm, and not necessarily the theoretical motivation for the computations involved, may wish to skip this section.</p><p>Readers more familiar with traditional machine learning may nd the relationships between UMAP, t-SNE and Largeviz located in Appendix C enlightening. Unfortunately, this purely computational view fails to shed any light upon the reasoning that underlies the algorithmic decisions made in UMAP. Without strong theoretical foundations the only arguments which can be made about algorithms amount to empirical measures, for which there are no clear universal choices for unsupervised problems.</p><p>At a high level, UMAP uses local manifold approximations and patches together their local fuzzy simplicial set representations to construct a topological representation of the high dimensional data. Given some low dimensional representation of the data, a similar process can be used to construct an equivalent topological representation. UMAP then optimizes the layout of the data representation in the low dimensional space, to minimize the cross-entropy between the two topological representations.</p><p>e construction of fuzzy topological representations can be broken down into two problems: approximating a manifold on which the data is assumed to lie; and constructing a fuzzy simplicial set representation of the approximated manifold. In explaining the algorithm we will rst discuss the method of approximating the manifold for the source data. Next we will discuss how to construct a fuzzy simplicial set structure from the manifold approximation. Finally, we will discuss the construction of the fuzzy simplicial set associated to a low dimensional representation (where the manifold is simply R d ), and how to optimize the representation with respect to our objective function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Uniform distribution of data on a manifold and geodesic approximation</head><p>e rst step of our algorithm is to approximate the manifold we assume the data (approximately) lies on.</p><p>e manifold may be known apriori (as simply R n ) or may need to be inferred from the data. Suppose the manifold is not known in advance and we wish to approximate geodesic distance on it. Let the input data be X = {X 1 , . . . , X N }. As in the work of Belkin and Niyogi on Laplacian eigenmaps <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>, for theoretical reasons it is bene cial to assume the data is uniformly distributed on the manifold, and even if that assumption is not made (e.g <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>) results are only valid in the limit of in nite data. In practice, nite real world data is rarely so nicely behaved. However, if we assume that the manifold has a Riemannian metric not inherited from the ambient space, we can nd a metric such that the data is approximately uniformly distributed with regard to that metric.</p><p>Formally, let M be the manifold we assume the data to lie on, and let g be the Riemannian metric on M. us, for each point p ∈ M we have g p , an inner product on the tangent space T p M. Lemma 1. Let (M, g) be a Riemannian manifold in an ambient R n , and let p ∈ M be a point. If g is locally constant about p in an open neighbourhood U such that g is a constant diagonal matrix in ambient coordinates, then in a ball B ⊆ U centered at p with volume π n/2 Γ(n/2+1) with respect to g, the geodesic distance from p to any point q ∈ B is 1 r d R n (p, q), where r is the radius of the ball in the ambient space and d R n is the existing metric on the ambient space.</p><p>See Appendix A of the supplementary materials for a proof of Lemma 1.</p><p>If we assume the data to be uniformly distributed on M (with respect to g) then, away from any boundaries, any ball of xed volume should contain approximately the same number of points of X regardless of where on the manifold it is centered. Given nite data and small enough local neighborhoods this crude approximation should be accurate enough even for data samples near manifold boundaries. Now, conversely, a ball centered at X i that contains exactly the k-nearest-neighbors of X i should have approximately xed volume regardless of the choice of X i ∈ X. Under Lemma 1 it follows that we can approximate geodesic distance from X i to its neighbors by normalising distances with respect to the distance to the k th nearest neighbor of X i .</p><p>In essence, by creating a custom distance for each X i , we can ensure the validity of the assumption of uniform distribution on the manifold. e cost is that we now have an independent notion of distance for each and every X i , and these notions of distance may not be compatible. We have a family of discrete metric spaces (one for each X i ) that we wish to merge into a consistent global structure.</p><p>is can be done in a natural way by converting the metric spaces into fuzzy simplicial sets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Fuzzy topological representation</head><p>We will use functors between the relevant categories to convert from metric spaces to fuzzy topological representations.</p><p>is will provide a means to merge the incompatible local views of the data. e topological structure of choice is that of simplicial sets. For more details on simplicial sets we refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, or <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Our approach draws heavily upon the work of Michael Barr <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and David Spivak in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, and many of the de nitions and theorems below are drawn or adapted from those sources. We assume familiarity with the basics of category theory. For an introduction to category theory readers may consult <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</p><p>To start we will review the de nitions for simplicial sets. Simplicial sets provide a combinatorial approach to the study of topological spaces. ey are related to the simpler notion of simplicial complexes -which construct topological spaces by gluing together simple building blocks called simplices -but are more general. Simplicial sets are most easily de ned purely abstractly in the language of category theory.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>De nition 2.</head><p>A simplicial set is a functor from ∆ op to Sets, the category of sets; that is, a contravariant functor from ∆ to Sets.</p><p>Given a simplicial set X : ∆ op → Sets, it is common to denote the set X([n]) as X n and refer to the elements of the set as the n-simplices of X.</p><p>e simplest possible examples of simplicial sets are the standard simplices ∆ n , de ned as the representable functors hom ∆ (•, [n]). It follows from the Yoneda lemma that there is a natural correspondence between n-simplices of X and morphisms ∆ n → X in the category of simplicial sets, and it is o en helpful to think in these terms. us for each x ∈ X n we have a corresponding morphism x : ∆ n → X. By the density theorem and employing a minor abuse of notation we then have</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">colim x∈Xn ∆ n ∼ = X ere is a standard covariant functor | • | : ∆ → Top mapping from the category ∆ to the category of topological spaces that sends [n] to the standard n-simplex |∆ n | ⊂ R n+1 de ned as |∆ n | (t 0 , . . . , t n ) ∈ R n+1 | n i=0 t i = 1, t i ≥ 0</formula><p>with the standard subspace topology. If X : ∆ op → Sets is a simplicial set then we can construct the realization of X (denoted |X|) as the colimit</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">|X| = colim x∈Xn |∆ n |</formula><p>and thus associate a topological space with a given simplicial set. Conversely given a topological space Y we can construct an associated simplicial set S(Y ), called the singular set of Y , by de ning</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">S(Y ) : [n] → hom Top (|∆ n |, Y ).</formula><p>It is a standard result of classical homotopy theory that the realization functor and singular set functors form an adjunction, and provide the standard means of translating between topological spaces and simplicial sets. Our goal will be to adapt these powerful classical results to the case of nite metric spaces. We draw signi cant inspiration from Spivak, speci cally <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, where he extends the classical theory of singular sets and topological realization to fuzzy singular sets and metric realization. To develop this theory here we will rst outline a categorical presentation of fuzzy sets, due to <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, that will make extending classical simplicial sets to fuzzy simplicial sets most natural.</p><p>Classically a fuzzy set <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[65]</ref> is de ned in terms of a carrier set A and a map µ : A → [0, 1] called the membership function. One is to interpret the value µ(x) for x ∈ A to be the membership strength of x to the set A. us membership of a set is no longer a bi-valent true or false property as in classical set theory, but a fuzzy property taking values in the unit interval. We wish to formalize this in terms of category theory.</p><p>Let I be the unit interval (0, 1] ⊆ R with topology given by intervals of the form [0, a) for a ∈ (0, 1]. e category of open sets (with morphisms given by inclusions) can be imbued with a Grothendieck topology in the natural way for any poset category.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>De nition 3.</head><p>A presheaf P on I is a functor from I op to Sets. A fuzzy set is a presheaf on I such that all maps P(a ≤ b) are injections.</p><p>Presheaves on I form a category with morphisms given by natural transformations. We can thus form a category of fuzzy sets by simply restricting to the sub-category of presheaves that are fuzzy sets. We note that such presheaves are trivially sheaves under the Grothendieck topology on I. As one might expect, limits (including products) of such sheaves are well de ned, but care must be taken to de ne colimits (and coproducts) of sheaves. To link to the classical approach to fuzzy sets one can think of a section P([0, a)) as the set of all elements with membership strength at least a. We can now de ne the category of fuzzy sets.</p><p>De nition 4. e category Fuzz of fuzzy sets is the full subcategory of sheaves on I spanned by fuzzy sets.</p><p>With this categorical presentation in hand, de ning fuzzy simplicial sets is simply a ma er of considering presheaves of ∆ valued in the category of fuzzy sets rather than the category of sets.</p><p>De nition 5. e category of fuzzy simplicial sets sFuzz is the category with objects given by functors from ∆ op to Fuzz, and morphisms given by natural transformations.</p><p>Alternatively, a fuzzy simplicial set can be viewed as a sheaf over ∆×I, where ∆ is given the trivial topology and ∆ × I has the product topology. We will use ∆ n &lt;a to denote the sheaf given by the representable functor of the object ([n], [0, a)). e importance of this fuzzy (shea ed) version of simplicial sets is their relationship to metric spaces. We begin by considering the larger category of extended-pseudo-metric spaces.</p><p>De nition 6. An extended-pseudo-metric space (X, d) is a set X and a map d : X × X → R ≥0 ∪ {∞} such that 1. d(x, y) 0, and x = y implies d(x, y) = 0;</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">2. d(x, y) = d(y, x); and 3. d(x, z) d(x, y) + d(y, z) or d(x, z) = ∞.</formula><p>e category of extended-pseudo-metric spaces EPMet has as objects extendedpseudo-metric spaces and non-expansive maps as morphisms. We denote the subcategory of nite extended-pseudo-metric spaces FinEPMet.</p><p>e choice of non-expansive maps in De nition 6 is due to Spivak, but we note that it closely mirrors the work of Carlsson and Memoli in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> on topological methods for clustering as applied to nite metric spaces. is choice is signi cant since pure isometries are too strict and do not provide large enough Hom-sets.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> Spivak constructs a pair of adjoint functors, Real and Sing between the categories sFuzz and EPMet. ese functors are the natural extension of the classical realization and singular set functors from algebraic topology. e functor Real is de ned in terms of standard fuzzy simplices ∆ n &lt;a as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Real(∆ n &lt;a ) (t 0 , . . . , t n ) ∈ R n+1 | n i=0 t i = -log(</formula><p>a), t i ≥ 0 similarly to the classical realization functor | • |. e metric on Real(∆ n &lt;a ) is simply inherited from R n+1 . A morphism ∆ n &lt;a → ∆ m &lt;b exists only if a ≤ b, and is determined by a ∆ morphism σ : [n] → [m]. e action of Real on such a morphism is given by the map</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">(x 0 , x 1 , . . . , x n ) → log(b) log(a)   i 0 ∈σ -1 (0) x i 0 , i 0 ∈σ -1 (1)</formula><p>x i 0 , . . . ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">i 0 ∈σ -1 (m) x i 0   . Such a map is clearly non-expansive since 0 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 1 implies that log(b)/ log(a) ≤ 1.</formula><p>We then extend this to a general simplicial set X via colimits, de ning Real(X) colim</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">∆ n &lt;a →X Real(∆ n &lt;a ).</formula><p>Since the functor Real preserves colimits, it follows that there exists a right adjoint functor. Again, analogously to the classical case, we nd the right adjoint, denoted Sing, is de ned for an extended pseudo metric space Y in terms of its action on the category ∆ × I:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Sing(Y ) : ([n], [0, a)) → hom EPMet (Real(∆ n &lt;a ), Y ).</formula><p>For our case we are only interested in nite metric spaces. To correspond with this we consider the subcategory of bounded fuzzy simplicial sets Fin-sFuzz. We therefore use the analogous adjoint pair FinReal and FinSing. Formally we de ne the nite fuzzy realization functor as follows: De nition 7. De ne the functor FinReal : Fin-sFuzz → FinEPMet by se ing FinReal(∆ n &lt;a ) ({x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n }, d a ), where</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">d a (x i , x j ) =    -log(a) if i = j,<label>0 otherwise</label></formula><p>. and then de ning</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">FinReal(X) colim ∆ n &lt;a →X FinReal(∆ n &lt;a ).</formula><p>Similar to Spivak's construction, the action of FinReal on a map ∆ n &lt;a → ∆ m &lt;b , where a ≤ b de ned by σ : ∆ n → ∆ m , is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">({x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n }, d a ) → ({x σ(1) , x σ(2) , . . . , x σ(n) }, d b ), which is a non-expansive map since a ≤ b implies d a ≥ d b .</formula><p>Since FinReal preserves colimits it admits a right adjoint, the fuzzy singular set functor FinSing. We can then de ne the ( nite) fuzzy singular set functor in terms of the action of its image on ∆ × I, analogously to Sing. We then have the following theorem. e proof of this is by construction. Appendix B provides a full proof of the theorem.</p><p>With the necessary theoretical background in place, the means to handle the family of incompatible metric spaces described above becomes clear. Each metric space in the family can be translated into a fuzzy simplicial set via the fuzzy singular set functor, distilling the topological information while still retaining metric information in the fuzzy structure. Ironing out the incompatibilities of the resulting family of fuzzy simplicial sets can be done by simply taking a (fuzzy) union across the entire family. e result is a single fuzzy simplicial set which captures the relevant topological and underlying metric structure of the manifold M.</p><p>It should be noted, however, that the fuzzy singular set functor applies to extended-pseudo-metric spaces, which are a relaxation of traditional metric spaces.</p><p>e results of Lemma 1 only provide accurate approximations of geodesic distance local to X i for distances measured from X ithe geodesic distances between other pairs of points within the neighborhood of X i are not well de ned. In deference to this lack of information we de ne distances between X j and X k in the extended-pseudo metric space local to X i (where i = j and i = k) to be in nite (local neighborhoods of X j and X k will provide suitable approximations).</p><p>For real data it is safe to assume that the manifold M is locally connected. In practice this can be realized by measuring distance in the extendedpseudo-metric space local to X i as geodesic distance beyond the nearest neighbor of X i . Since this sets the distance to the nearest neighbor to be equal to 0 this is only possible in the more relaxed se ing of extendedpseudo-metric spaces. It ensures, however, that each 0-simplex is the face of some 1-simplex with fuzzy membership strength 1, meaning that the resulting topological structure derived from the manifold is locally connected. We note that this has a similar practical e ect to the truncated similarity approach of Lee and Verleysen <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, but derives naturally from the assumption of local connectivity of the manifold.</p><p>Combining all of the above we can de ne the fuzzy topological representation of a dataset. De nition 9. Let X = {X 1 , . . . , X N } be a dataset in R n . Let {(X, d i )} i=1...N be a family of extended-pseudo-metric spaces with common carrier set X such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">d i (X j , X k ) =    d M (X j , X k ) -ρ if i = j or i = k, ∞ otherwise ,</formula><p>where ρ is the distance to the nearest neighbor of X i and d M is geodesic distance on the manifold M, either known apriori, or approximated as per Lemma 1. e fuzzy topological representation of X is n i=1</p><p>FinSing((X, d i )).</p><p>e (fuzzy set) union provides the means to merge together the di erent metric spaces. is provides a single fuzzy simplicial set as the global representation of the manifold formed by patching together the many local representations.</p><p>Given the ability to construct such topological structures, either from a known manifold, or by learning the metric structure of the manifold, we can perform dimension reduction by simply nding low dimensional representations that closely match the topological structure of the source data. We now consider the task of nding such a low dimensional representation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Optimizing a low dimensional representation</head><formula xml:id="formula_13">Let Y = {Y 1 , . . . , Y N } ⊆ R d be a low dimensional (d n)</formula><p>representation of X such that Y i represents the source data point X i . In contrast to the source data where we want to estimate a manifold on which the data is uniformly distributed, a target manifold for Y is chosen apriori (usually this will simply be R d itself, but other choices such as d-spheres or d-tori are certainly possible) . erefore we know the manifold and manifold metric apriori, and can compute the fuzzy topological representation directly. Of note, we still want to incorporate the distance to the nearest neighbor as per the local connectedness requirement. is can be achieved by supplying a parameter that de nes the expected distance between nearest neighbors in the embedded space.</p><p>Given fuzzy simplicial set representations of X and Y , a means of comparison is required. If we consider only the 1-skeleton of the fuzzy simplicial sets we can describe each as a fuzzy graph, or, more speci cally, a fuzzy set of edges. To compare two fuzzy sets we will make use of fuzzy set cross entropy. For these purposes we will revert to classical fuzzy set notation. at is, a fuzzy set is given by a reference set A and a membership strength function µ : A → [0, 1]. Comparable fuzzy sets have the same reference set. Given a sheaf representation P we can translate to classical fuzzy sets by se ing A = a∈(0,1] P([0, a)) and µ</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">(x) = sup{a ∈ (0, 1] | x ∈ P([0, a))}.</formula><p>De nition 10. e cross entropy C of two fuzzy sets (A, µ) and (A, ν) is de ned as</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">C((A, µ), (A, ν)) a∈A µ(a) log µ(a) ν(a) + (1 -µ(a)) log 1 -µ(a) 1 -ν(a) .</formula><p>Similar to t-SNE we can optimize the embedding Y with respect to fuzzy set cross entropy C by using stochastic gradient descent. However, this requires a di erentiable fuzzy singular set functor. If the expected minimum distance between points is zero the fuzzy singular set functor is di erentiable for these purposes, however for any non-zero value we need to make a di erentiable approximation (chosen from a suitable family of di erentiable functions).</p><p>is completes the algorithm: by using manifold approximation and patching together local fuzzy simplicial set representations we construct a topological representation of the high dimensional data. We then optimize the layout of data in a low dimensional space to minimize the error between the two topological representations.</p><p>We note that in this case we restricted a ention to comparisons of the 1-skeleton of the fuzzy simplicial sets. One can extend this to -skeleta by de ning a cost function C as</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">C (X, Y ) = i=1 λ i C(X i , Y i ),</formula><p>where X i denotes the fuzzy set of i-simplices of X and the λ i are suitably chosen real valued weights. While such an approach will capture the overall topological structure more accurately, it comes at non-negligible computational cost due to the increasingly large numbers of higher dimensional simplices. For this reason current implementations restrict to the 1-skeleton at this time.</p></div>

For that motivation please see Section 2.</p><p>e theoretical description of the algorithm works in terms of fuzzy simplicial sets. Computationally this is only tractable for the one skeleton which can ultimately be described as a weighted graph. is means that, from a practical computational perspective, UMAP can ultimately be described in terms of, construction of, and operations on, weighted graphs. In particular this situates UMAP in the class of k-neighbour based graph learning algorithms such as Laplacian Eigenmaps, Isomap and t-SNE.</p><p>As with other k-neighbour graph based algorithms, UMAP can be described in two phases. In the rst phase a particular weighted k-neighbour graph is constructed. In the second phase a low dimensional layout of this graph is computed.</p><p>e di erences between all algorithms in this class amount to speci c details in how the graph is constructed and how the layout is computed. e theoretical basis for UMAP as described in Section 2 provides novel approaches to both of these phases, and provides clear motivation for the choices involved.</p><p>Finally, since t-SNE is not usually described as a graph based algorithm, a direct comparison of UMAP with t-SNE, using the similarity/probability notation commonly used to express the equations of t-SNE, is given in the Appendix C.</p><p>In section 2 we made a few basic assumptions about our data. From these assumptions we made use of category theory to derive the UMAP algorithms. at said, all these derivations assume these axioms to be true.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Graph Construction</head><p>e rst phase of UMAP can be thought of as the construction of a weighted k-neighbour graph. Let X = {x 1 , . . . , x N } be the input dataset, with a metric (or dissimilarity measure) d : X ×X → R ≥0 . Given an input hyperparameter k, for each x i we compute the set {x i 1 , . . . , x i k } of the k nearest neighbors of x i under the metric d. is computation can be performed via any nearest neighbour or approximate nearest neighbour search algorithm. For the purposes of our UMAP implemenation we prefer to use the nearest neighbor descent algorithm of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>For each x i we will de ne ρ i and σ i .

In particular it ensures that x i connects to at least one other data point with an edge of weight 1; this is equivalent to the resulting fuzzy simplicial set being locally connected at x i . In practical terms this significantly improves the representation on very high dimensional data where other algorithms such as t-SNE begin to su er from the curse of dimensionality.</p><p>e selection of σ i corresponds to (a smoothed) normalisation factor, de ning the Riemannian metric local to the point x i as described in Section 2.1.</p><p>We can now de ne a weighted directed graph Ḡ = (V, E, w). e vertices V of Ḡ are simply the set X. We can then form the set of directed edges</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">E = {(x i , x i j ) | 1 ≤ j ≤ k, 1 ≤ i ≤ N },</formula><p>and de ne the weight function w by se ing</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">w((x i , x i j )) = exp -max(0, d(x i , x i j ) -ρ i ) σ i .</formula><p>For a given point x i there exists an induced graph of x i and outgoing edges incident on x i . is graph is the 1-skeleton of the fuzzy simplicial set associated to the metric space local to x i where the local metric is de ned in terms of ρ i and σ i . e weight associated to the edge is the membership strength of the corresponding 1-simplex within the fuzzy simplicial set, and is derived from the adjunction of eorem 1 using the right adjoint (nearest inverse) of the geometric realization of a fuzzy simplicial set. Intuitively one can think of the weight of an edge as akin to the probability that the given edge exists. Section 2 demonstrates why this construction faithfully captures the topology of the data. Given this set of local graphs (represented here as a single directed graph) we now require a method to combine them into a uni ed topological representation. We note that while patching together incompatible nite metric spaces is challenging, by using eorem 1 to convert to a fuzzy simplicial set representation, the combining operation becomes natural.</p><p>Let A be the weighted adjacency matrix of Ḡ, and consider the symmetric matrix</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">B = A + A -A • A ,</formula><p>where • is the Hadamard (or pointwise) product. is formula derives from the use of the probabilistic t-conorm used in unioning the fuzzy simplicial sets. If one interprets the value of A ij as the probability that the directed edge from x i to x j exists, then B ij is the probability that at least one of the two directed edges (from x i to x j and from x j to x i ) exists. e UMAP graph G is then an undirected weighted graph whose adjacency matrix is given by B. Section 2 explains this construction in topological terms, providing the justi cation for why this construction provides an appropriate fuzzy topological representation of the data -that is, this construction captures the underlying geometric structure of the data in a faithful way.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Graph Layout</head><p>In practice UMAP uses a force directed graph layout algorithm in low dimensional space. A force directed graph layout utilizes of a set of a ractive forces applied along edges and a set of repulsive forces applied among vertices. Any force directed layout algorithm requires a description of both the a ractive and repulsive forces. e algorithm proceeds by iteratively applying a ractive and repulsive forces at each edge or vertex. is amounts to a non-convex optimization problem. Convergence to a local minima is guaranteed by slowly decreasing the a ractive and repulsive forces in a similar fashion to that used in simulated annealing.</p><p>In UMAP the a ractive force between two vertices i and j at coordinates y i and y j respectively, is determined by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">-2ab y i -y j 2(b-1) 2 1 + y i -y j 2 2 w((x i , x j )) (y i -y j )</formula><p>where a and b are hyper-parameters.

Since the weighted graph G captures the topology of the source data, the equivalent weighted graph H constructed from the points {y i } i=1..N matches the topology as closely as the optimization allows, and thus provides a good low dimensional representation of the overall topology of the data.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Hyper-parameters</head><p>As described in Algorithm 1, the UMAP algorithm takes four hyper-parameters:</p><p>1. n, the number of neighbors to consider when approximating the local metric;</p><p>2. d, the target embedding dimension;</p><p>3. min-dist, the desired separation between close points in the embedding space; and 4. n-epochs, the number of training epochs to use when optimizing the low dimensional representation.</p><p>e e ects of the parameters d and n-epochs are largely self-evident, and will not be discussed in further detail here. In contrast the e ects of the number of neighbors n and of min-dist are less clear.</p><p>One can interpret the number of neighbors n as the local scale at which to approximate the manifold as roughly at, with the manifold estimation averaging over the n neighbors. Manifold features that occur at a smaller scale than within the n nearest-neighbors of points will be lost, while large scale manifold features that cannot be seen by patching together locally at charts at the scale of n nearest-neighbors may not be well detected. us n represents some degree of trade-o between ne grained and large scale manifold features -smaller values will ensure detailed manifold structure is accurately captured (at a loss of the "big picture" view of the manifold), while larger values will capture large scale manifold structures, but at a loss of ne detail structure which will get averaged out in the local approximations. With smaller n values the manifold tends to be broken into many small connected components (care needs to be taken with the spectral embedding for initialization in such cases).</p><p>In contrast min-dist is a hyperparameter directly a ecting the output, as it controls the fuzzy simplicial set construction from the low dimensional representation. It acts in lieu of the distance to the nearest neighbor used to ensure local connectivity. In essence this determines how closely points can be packed together in the low dimensional representation. Low values on min-dist will result in potentially densely packed regions, but will likely more faithfully represent the manifold structure. Increasing the value of min-dist will force the embedding to spread points out more, assisting visualization (and avoiding potential overplo ing issues). We view min-dist as an essentially aesthetic parameter, governing the appearance of the embedding, and thus is more important when using UMAP for visualization.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> we provide examples of the e ects of varying the hyperparameters for a toy dataset. e data is uniform random samples from a 3-dimensional color-cube, allowing for easy visualization of the original 3dimensional coordinates in the embedding space by using the corresponding RGB colour. Since the data lls a 3-dimensional cube there is no local manifold structure, and hence for such data we expect larger n values to be more useful.

For example, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref> shows both UMAP and t-SNE embeddings of the COIL20, MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and Google News datasets. While the precise embeddings are di erent, UMAP distinguishes the same structures as t-SNE and LargeVis. It can be argued that UMAP has captured more of the global and topological structure of the datasets than t-SNE <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">62]</ref>. More of the loops in the COIL20 dataset are kept intact, including the intertwined loops. Similarly the global relationships among di erent digits in the MNIST digits dataset are more clearly captured with 1 (red) and 0 (dark red) at far corners of the embedding space, and 4,7,9 (yellow, sea-green, and violet) and 3,5,8 (orange, chartreuse, and blue) separated as distinct clumps of similar digits. In the Fashion MNIST dataset the distinction between clothing (dark red, yellow, orange, vermilion) and footwear (chartreuse, sea-green, and violet) is made more clear.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Weaknesses</head><p>While we believe UMAP to be a very e ective algorithm for both visualization and dimension reduction, most algorithms must make trade-o s and UMAP is no exception. In this section we will brie y discuss those areas or use cases where UMAP is less e ective, and suggest potential alternatives.</p><p>For a number of use cases the interpretability of the reduced dimension results is of critical importance. Similarly to most non-linear dimension reduction techniques (including t-SNE and Isomap), UMAP lacks the strong interpretability of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and related techniques such a Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). In particular the dimensions of the UMAP embedding space have no speci c meaning, unlike PCA where the dimensions are the directions of greatest variance in the source data. Furthermore, since UMAP is based on the distance between observations rather than the source features, it does not have an equivalent of factor loadings that linear techniques such as PCA, or Factor Analysis can provide. If strong interpretability is critical we therefore recommend linear techniques such as PCA, NMF or pLSA.</p><p>One of the core assumptions of UMAP is that there exists manifold structure in the data. Because of this UMAP can tend to nd manifold structure within the noise of a dataset -similar to the way the human mind nds structured constellations among the stars. As more data is sampled the amount of structure evident from noise will tend to decrease and UMAP becomes more robust, however care must be taken with small sample sizes of noisy data, or data with only large scale manifold structure. Detecting when a spurious embedding has occurred is a topic of further research.</p><p>UMAP is derived from the axiom that local distance is of more importance than long range distances (similar to techniques like t-SNE and LargeVis). UMAP therefore concerns itself primarily with accurately representing local structure. While we believe that UMAP can capture more global structure than these other techniques, it remains true that if global    structure is of primary interest then UMAP may not be the best choice for dimension reduction. Multi-dimensional scaling speci cally seeks to preserve the full distance matrix of the data, and as such is a good candidate when all scales of structure are of equal importance. PHATE <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> is a good example of a hybrid approach that begins with local structure information and makes use of MDS to a empt to preserve long scale distances as well. It should be noted that these techniques are more computationally intensive and thus rely on landmarking approaches for scalability.</p><p>It should also be noted that a signi cant contributor to UMAP's relative global structure preservation is derived from the Laplacian Eigenmaps initialization (which, in turn, followed from the theoretical foundations). is was noted in, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>e authors of that paper demonstrate that t-SNE, with similar initialization, can perform equivalently to UMAP in a particular measure of global structure preservation. However, the objective function derived for UMAP (cross-entropy) is signi cantly di erent from that of t-SNE (KL-divergence), in how it penalizes failures to preserve non-local and global structure, and is also a signi cant contributor <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">6</ref> .</p><p>It is worth noting that, in combining the local simplicial set structures, pure nearest neighbor structure in the high dimensional space is not explicitly preserved. In particular it introduces so called "reverse-nearestneighbors" into the classical knn-graph. is, combined with the fact that UMAP is preserving topology rather than pure metric structures, mean that UMAP will not perform as well as some methods on quality measures based on metric structure preservation -particularly methods, such as MDSwhich are explicitly designed to optimize metric structure preservation.</p><p>UMAP a empts to discover a manifold on which your data is uniformly distributed. If you have strong con dence in the ambient distances of your data you should make use of a technique that explicitly a empts to preserve these distances. For example if your data consisted of a very loose structure in one area of your ambient space and a very dense structure in another region region UMAP would a empt to put these local areas on an even footing.</p><p>Finally, to improve the computational e ciency of the algorithm a number of approximations are made.</p><p>is can have an impact on the results of UMAP for small (less than 500 samples) dataset sizes. In particular the use of approximate nearest neighbor algorithms, and the negative sampling used in optimization, can result in suboptimal embeddings. For this reason we encourage users to take care with particularly small datasets. A slower but exact implementation of UMAP for small datasets is a future project.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Future Work</head><p>Having established both relevant mathematical theory and a concrete implementation, there still remains signi cant scope for future developments of UMAP.</p><p>A comprehensive empirical study which examines the impact of the various algorithmic components, choices, and hyper-parameters of the algorithm would be bene cial. While the structure and choices of the algorithm presented were derived from our foundational mathematical framework, examining the impacts that these choices have on practical results would be enlightening and a signi cant contribution to the literature.</p><p>As noted in the weaknesses section there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the preservation of global structure among the eld of manifold learning algorithms. In particular this is hampered by the lack clear objective measures, or even de nitions, of global structure preservation. While some metrics exist, they are not comprehensive, and are o en speci c to various downstream tasks. A systematic study of both metrics of non-local and global structure preservation, and performance of various manifold learning algorithms with respect to them, would be of great bene t. We believe this would aid in be er understanding UMAP's success in various downstream tasks.</p><p>Making use of the fuzzy simplicial set representation of data UMAP can potentially be extended to support (semi-)supervised dimension reduction, and dimension reduction for datasets with heterogeneous data types. Each data type (or prediction variables in the supervised case) can be seen as an alternative view of the underlying structure, each with a di erent associated metric -for example categorical data may use Jaccard or Dice distance, while ordinal data might use Manha an distance. Each view and metric can be used to independently generate fuzzy simplicial sets, which can then be intersected together to create a single fuzzy simplicial set for embedding. Extending UMAP to work with mixed data types would vastly increase the range of datasets to which it can be applied. Use cases for (semi-)supervised dimension reduction include semi-supervised clustering, and interactive labelling tools. e computational framework established for UMAP allows for the potential development of techniques to add new unseen data points into an existing embedding, and to generate high dimensional representations of arbitrary points in the embedded space. Furthermore, the combination of supervision and the addition of new samples to an existing embedding provides avenues for metric learning. e addition of new samples to an existing embedding would allow UMAP to be used as a feature engineering tool as part of a general machine learning pipeline for either clustering or classi cation tasks. Pulling points back to the original high dimensional space from the embedded space would potentially allow UMAP to be used as a generative model similar to some use cases for autoencoders. Finally, there are many use cases for metric learning; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[64]</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> for example.</p><p>ere also remains signi cant scope to develop techniques to both detect and mitigate against potentially spurious embeddings, particularly for small data cases. e addition of such techniques would make UMAP far more robust as a tool for exploratory data analysis, a common use case when reducing to two dimensions for visualization purposes.</p><p>Experimental versions of some of this work are already available in the referenced implementations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C From t-SNE to UMAP</head><p>As an aid to implementation of UMAP and to illuminate the algorithmic similarities with t-SNE and LargeVis, here we review the main equations used in those methods, and then present the equivalent UMAP expressions in a notation which may be more familiar to users of those other methods.</p><p>In what follows we are concerned with de ning similarities between two objects i and j in the high dimensional input space X and low dimensional embedded space Y . ese are normalized and symmetrized in various ways. In a typical implementation, these pair-wise quantities are stored and manipulated as (potentially sparse) matrices.</p><p>antities with the subscript ij are symmetric, i.e. v ij = v ji . Extending the conditional probability notation used in t-SNE, j | i indicates an asymmetric similarity, i.e. v j|i = v i|j .</p><p>t-SNE de nes input probabilities in three stages. First, for each pair of points, i and j, in X, a pair-wise similarity, v ij , is calculated, Gaussian with respect to the Euclidean distance between x i and x j :</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">v j|i = exp(-x i -x j 2 2 /2σ 2 i )<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where σ 2 i is the variance of the Gaussian. Second, the similarities are converted into N conditional probability distributions by normalization:</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">p j|i = v j|i k =i v k|i<label>(6)</label></formula><p>σ i is chosen by searching for a value such that the perplexity of the probability distribution p •|i matches a user-speci ed value. ird, these probability distributions are symmetrized and then further normalized over the entire matrix of values to give a joint probability distribution:</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">p ij = p j|i + p i|j 2N<label>(7)</label></formula><p>We note that this is a heuristic de nition and not in accordance with standard relationship between conditional and joint probabilities that would be expected under probability semantics usually used to describe t-SNE. Similarities between pairs of points in the output space Y are de ned using a Student t-distribution with one degree of freedom on the squared Euclidean distance:</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">w ij = 1 + y i -y j 2 2</formula><p>-1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> followed by the matrix-wise normalization, to form q ij :</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">q ij = w ij k =l w kl<label>(9)</label></formula><p>e t-SNE cost is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the two probability distributions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">C t-SN E = i =j p ij log p ij q ij<label>(10)</label></formula><p>this can be expanded into constant and non-constant contributions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">C t-SN E = i =j p ij log p ij -p ij log q ij<label>(11)</label></formula><p>Because both p ij and q ij require calculations over all pairs of points, improving the e ciency of t-SNE algorithms has involved separate strategies for approximating these quantities. Similarities in the high dimensions are e ectively zero outside of the nearest neighbors of each point due to the calibration of the p j|i values to reproduce a desired perplexity. erefore an approximation used in Barnes-Hut t-SNE is to only calculate v j|i for n nearest neighbors of i, where n is a multiple of the user-selected perplexity and to assume v j|i = 0 for all other j. Because the low dimensional coordinates change with each iteration, a di erent approach is used to approximate q ij . In Barnes-Hut t-SNE and related methods this usually involves grouping together points whose contributions can be approximated as a single point.</p><p>A further heuristic algorithm optimization technique employed by t-SNE implementations is the use of early exaggeration where, for some number of initial iterations, the p ij are multiplied by some constant greater than 1.0 (usually 12.0). In theoretical analyses of t-SNE such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> results are obtained only under an early exaggeration regimen with either large constant (of order of the number of samples), or in the limit of in nite exaggeration. Further papers such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, suggest the option of using exaggeration for all iterations rather than just early ones, and demonstrate the utility of this. e e ectiveness of these analyses and practical approaches suggests that KL-divergence as a measure between probability distributions is not what makes the t-SNE algorithm work, since, under exaggeration, the p ij are manifestly not a probability distribution.</p><p>is is another example of the probability semantics used to describe t-SNE are primarily descriptive rather than foundational. None the less, t-SNE is highly e ective and clearly produces useful results on a very wide variety of tasks.</p><p>LargeVis uses a similar approach to Barnes-Hut t-SNE when approximating p ij , but further improves e ciency by only requiring approximate nearest neighbors for each point. For the low dimensional coordinates, it abandons normalization of w ij entirely. Rather than use the Kullback-Leibler divergence, it optimizes a likelihood function, and hence is maximized, not minimized:</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">C LV = i =j p ij log w ij + γ i =j log (1 -w ij )<label>(12)</label></formula><p>p ij and w ij are de ned as in Barnes-Hut t-SNE (apart from the use of approximate nearest neighbors for p ij , and the fact that, in implementation, LargeVis does not normalize the p ij by N ) and γ is a user-chosen positive constant which weights the strength of the the repulsive contributions (second term) relative to the a ractive contribution ( rst term). Note also that the rst term resembles the optimizable part of the Kullback-Leibler divergence but using w ij instead of q ij . Abandoning calculation of q ij is a crucial change, because the LargeVis cost function is amenable to optimization via stochastic gradient descent.</p><p>Ignoring speci c de nitions of v ij and w ij , the UMAP cost function, the cross entropy, is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">C U M AP = i =j v ij log v ij w ij + (1 -v ij ) log 1 -v ij 1 -w ij<label>(13)</label></formula><p>Like the Kullback-Leibler divergence, this can be arranged into two constant contributions (those containing v ij only) and two optimizable contributions (containing w ij ):</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">C U M AP = i =j v ij log v ij + (1 -v ij ) log (1 -v ij ) -v ij log w ij -(1 -v ij ) log (1 -w ij )<label>(14)</label></formula><p>Ignoring the two constant terms, the UMAP cost function has a very similar form to that of LargeVis, but without a γ term to weight the repulsive component of the cost function, and without requiring matrix-wise normalization in the high dimensional space. e cost function for UMAP can therefore be optimized (in this case, minimized) with stochastic gradient descent in the same way as LargeVis.</p><p>Although the above discussion places UMAP in the same family of methods as t-SNE and LargeVis, it does not use the same de nitions for v ij and w ij . Using the notation established above, we now provide the equivalent expressions for the UMAP similarities. In the high dimensional space, the similarities v j|i are the local fuzzy simplicial set memberships, based on the smooth nearest neighbors distances:</p><formula xml:id="formula_51">v j|i = exp[(-d (x i , x j ) -ρ i )/σ i ]<label>(15)</label></formula><p>As with LargeVis, v j|i is calculated only for n approximate nearest neighbors and v j|i = 0 for all other j. d (x i , x j ) is the distance between x i and x j , which UMAP does not require to be Euclidean. ρ i is the distance to the nearest neighbor of i. σ i is the normalizing factor, which is chosen by Algorithm 3 and plays a similar role to the perplexity-based calibration of σ i in t-SNE. Calculation of v j|i with Equation 15 corresponds to Algorithm 2.</p><p>Symmetrization is carried out by fuzzy set union using the probabilistic t-conorm and can be expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_52">v ij = v j|i + v i|j -v j|i v i|j<label>(16)</label></formula><p>Equation 16 corresponds to forming top-rep in Algorithm 1. Unlike t-SNE, further normalization is not carried out. e low dimensional similarities are given by: </p><formula xml:id="formula_53">w ij = 1 + a y i -y j 2b 2 -1<label>(17)</label></formula></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>De nition 8 .</head><label>8</label><figDesc>De ne the functor FinSing : FinEPMet → Fin-sFuzz by FinSing(Y ) : ([n], [0, a)) → hom FinEPMet (FinReal(∆ n &lt;a ), Y ).</figDesc></figure>
