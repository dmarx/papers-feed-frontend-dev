- **Problem Addressed**: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) leading to factually inaccurate content.
  
- **Proposed Solution**: Ewe (Explicit Working Memory) integrates a working memory that receives real-time feedback from external resources to enhance factuality in long-form text generation.

- **Key Mechanism**: 
  - Ewe maintains a memory of k relevant text chunks, allowing the model to attend to multiple sources of information in parallel.
  - Memory is refreshed based on online fact-checking and retrieval feedback during the generation process.

- **Memory Update Process**:
  - Ewe pauses generation to check newly generated sentences for factual accuracy.
  - If inaccuracies are found, the memory is updated with correct information and the generation process backtracks to the previous timestep.

- **Factuality Metric**: 
  - Ewe improves the VeriScore metric by 2 to 10 points absolute across four fact-seeking long-form generation datasets.

- **Comparison with RAG**: 
  - Unlike traditional RAG, which prepends retrieved documents to the input, Ewe processes retrieved knowledge in memory units, allowing for dynamic updates and more efficient information retrieval.

- **Feedback Types**:
  - **Fact-Checking Outcomes**: Correct information that refutes inaccuracies in generated sentences.
  - **Relevant Knowledge**: Retrieved passages based on the input question and the sentence being fact-checked.

- **Algorithm Overview**:

      A[Start Generation] --> B[Generate Sentence]
      B --> C{Check Factuality}
      C -- Yes --> D[Continue Generation]
      C -- No --> E[Retrieve Correct Facts]
      E --> F[Update Memory]
      F --> G[Backtrack and Regenerate]
      G --> D
  ```

- **Performance**: Ewe maintains similar helpfulness in instruction following compared to the base model Llama-3.1 70B while enhancing factual accuracy.

- **Related Work**: 
  - Ewe builds on concepts from iterative retrieval methods (e.g., FLARE, Self-RAG) but introduces a memory-augmented approach for more effective integration of feedback.

- **Memory Design**: 
  - Ewe's memory allows for operations such as update, append, or delete, providing flexibility for various downstream tasks and improving efficiency by reusing unchanged memory units.
