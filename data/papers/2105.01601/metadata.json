  "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the go-to model for computer vision.\nRecently, attention-based networks, such as the Vision Transformer, have also\nbecome popular. In this paper we show that while convolutions and attention are\nboth sufficient for good performance, neither of them are necessary. We present\nMLP-Mixer, an architecture based exclusively on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs).\nMLP-Mixer contains two types of layers: one with MLPs applied independently to\nimage patches (i.e. \"mixing\" the per-location features), and one with MLPs\napplied across patches (i.e. \"mixing\" spatial information). When trained on\nlarge datasets, or with modern regularization schemes, MLP-Mixer attains\ncompetitive scores on image classification benchmarks, with pre-training and\ninference cost comparable to state-of-the-art models. We hope that these\nresults spark further research beyond the realms of well established CNNs and\nTransformers.",
