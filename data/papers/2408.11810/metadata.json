  "abstract": "Diffusion Models have emerged as powerful generative models for high-quality\nimage synthesis, with many subsequent image editing techniques based on them.\nHowever, the ease of text-based image editing introduces significant risks,\nsuch as malicious editing for scams or intellectual property infringement.\nPrevious works have attempted to safeguard images from diffusion-based editing\nby adding imperceptible perturbations. These methods are costly and\nspecifically target prevalent Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), while\nPixel-domain Diffusion Models (PDMs) remain largely unexplored and robust\nagainst such attacks. Our work addresses this gap by proposing a novel\nattacking framework with a feature representation attack loss that exploits\nvulnerabilities in denoising UNets and a latent optimization strategy to\nenhance the naturalness of protected images. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach in attacking dominant PDM-based editing\nmethods (e.g., SDEdit) while maintaining reasonable protection fidelity and\nrobustness against common defense methods. Additionally, our framework is\nextensible to LDMs, achieving comparable performance to existing approaches.",
