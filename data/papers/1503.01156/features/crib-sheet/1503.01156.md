- **Quantile Summary Definition**: A quantile summary \( S \) approximates order statistics of a dataset \( X \) with \( |R(y, X_t) - \phi t| \leq \epsilon t \) for a query \( \phi \) and rank function \( R(a, Z) \).

- **Memory Complexity**: The proposed randomized online quantile summary uses \( O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon} \log \frac{1}{\epsilon}\right) \) words of memory, improving upon the previous bound of \( O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon} \log^{3/2} \frac{1}{\epsilon}\right) \).

- **Success Probability**: The summary guarantees a success probability of \( 1 - e^{-\text{poly}(1/\epsilon)} \) for the rank approximation.

- **Data Input Model**: The model operates under the cash register streaming model where items are added sequentially without prior knowledge of the total count.

- **Comparison Model**: The summary is designed for the comparison model, where items come from an arbitrary ordered domain.

- **Bernoulli Sampling**: Downsamples the stream \( X \) to a sample stream \( S \) with inclusion probability \( m/n \). Expected size of \( S \) is \( E(|S_t|) = \frac{mt}{n} \).

- **GK Summary**: The GK summary can return a sample \( y \) such that \( |R(y, X_t) - \rho| \leq \frac{\epsilon t}{8} \) using \( O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon} \log(\epsilon t)\right) \) words.

- **Algorithm Structure**: The algorithm combines Bernoulli sampling with the GK summary, processing items in rows, where each row \( r \) summarizes the first \( 2^r 32m \) items.

- **Row Processing**: Each row starts processing after seeing \( 1/64 \) of its total items and can only answer queries after seeing half of its items.

- **Error Analysis**: The total error introduced by both sampling and GK summary is at most \( \frac{\epsilon t}{2} \).

- **Caveats**: The algorithm requires prior knowledge of \( n \) and can only guarantee approximations after processing a constant fraction of the stream.

- **Lower Bound**: The lower bound for deterministic summaries in the comparison model is \( \Omega\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon} \log \frac{1}{\epsilon}\right) \), indicating the efficiency of the proposed randomized summary.

- **Theorem 2.1**: For \( t \geq n/64 \), the probability bounds for the size of \( S_t \) and the rank approximation are established, ensuring the reliability of the sampling method.

- **Row Structure**: Each row \( r \) has streams \( A_r \) (prefix), \( B_r \) (suffix), \( R_r \) (replacement), \( J_r \) (joint), \( S_r \) (sample), and \( Q_r \) (query stream).

- **Space Efficiency**: The algorithm maintains at most six active rows at any time, ensuring space usage remains \( O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon} \log \frac{1}{\epsilon}\right) \).

- **Query Handling**: Queries are answered by feeding the sample stream into the GK summary, with adjustments made to handle cases where \( \rho m/n \) exceeds the size of \( S \).
