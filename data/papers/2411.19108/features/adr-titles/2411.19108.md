- Decision to utilize a caching mechanism for video diffusion models
- Choice of Timestep Embedding Aware Cache (TeaCache) as the caching strategy
- Selection of input embeddings: noisy input, timestep embedding, and text embedding
- Method for estimating output differences based on input differences
- Implementation of polynomial fitting to correct scaling bias between input and output differences
- Decision to avoid additional training for the caching mechanism
- Choice of performance metrics for evaluating model outputs (e.g., relative L1 distance)
- Selection of video generation models for experimental analysis (Open Sora, Latte, OpenSora Plan)
- Decision to focus on the correlation between model inputs and outputs for caching strategy
- Choice of diffusion model architecture (DiT) for compatibility with TeaCache
- Decision to analyze the behavior of model outputs during the diffusion process
- Choice of empirical studies to validate the effectiveness of TeaCache
- Decision to compare TeaCache with existing caching strategies (e.g., PAB)
- Choice of evaluation criteria for visual quality and latency in model performance
- Decision to document the contributions of the proposed method in the paper
