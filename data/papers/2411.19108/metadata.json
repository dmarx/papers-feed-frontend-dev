  "abstract": "As a fundamental backbone for video generation, diffusion models are\nchallenged by low inference speed due to the sequential nature of denoising.\nPrevious methods speed up the models by caching and reusing model outputs at\nuniformly selected timesteps. However, such a strategy neglects the fact that\ndifferences among model outputs are not uniform across timesteps, which hinders\nselecting the appropriate model outputs to cache, leading to a poor balance\nbetween inference efficiency and visual quality. In this study, we introduce\nTimestep Embedding Aware Cache (TeaCache), a training-free caching approach\nthat estimates and leverages the fluctuating differences among model outputs\nacross timesteps. Rather than directly using the time-consuming model outputs,\nTeaCache focuses on model inputs, which have a strong correlation with the\nmodeloutputs while incurring negligible computational cost. TeaCache first\nmodulates the noisy inputs using the timestep embeddings to ensure their\ndifferences better approximating those of model outputs. TeaCache then\nintroduces a rescaling strategy to refine the estimated differences and\nutilizes them to indicate output caching. Experiments show that TeaCache\nachieves up to 4.41x acceleration over Open-Sora-Plan with negligible (-0.07%\nVbench score) degradation of visual quality.",
