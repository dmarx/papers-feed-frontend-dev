- **Definition of Emergence**: Emergence refers to novel properties or behaviors of a composite system that are not predictable from the properties of its individual parts.

- **Micro vs. Macro Descriptions**: Emergence is relevant when both micro (lower-level) and macro (higher-level) descriptions exist, capturing important properties of the system.

- **Types of Emergence**:
  - **Weak Emergence**: Higher-level properties are deducible from lower-level properties.
  - **Strong Emergence**: Higher-level properties are fundamentally new and not deducible from lower-level properties.

- **Epistemic vs. Ontological Emergence**:
  - **Epistemic Emergence**: Emergent features depend on different levels of knowledge.
  - **Ontological Emergence**: Emergent properties exist independently and are not reducible to lower-level properties.

- **Classification of Emergence**:
  - **Type-0 (Featureless) Emergence**: Many-to-one map from micro to macro theory, commuting with time evolution.
  - **Type-1 (Local) Emergence**: Many-to-one map that commutes with time evolution, where macro subsystems are made of specific micro subsystems.
    - **Type-1a (Direct) Emergence**: Algorithmically simple local emergence.
    - **Type-1b (Incompressible) Emergence**: Algorithmically complex local emergence.
  - **Type-2 (Nonlocal) Emergence**: Similar to Type-1 but allows for nonlocal macro entities or dynamics.
  - **Type-3 (Augmented) Emergence**: Introduces new ontological features in the macro theory absent in the micro theory.

- **Markovian Evolution**: Assumes future evolution depends only on the current state, not on prior history.

- **Mathematical Representation**:
  - Evolution of states: 
    - Micro theory: \( a(t + \Delta t) = E_\alpha[a(t)] \)
    - Macro theory: \( b(t + \Delta t) = E_\beta[b(t)] \)
  - Emergence relation: \( \Phi: A \to B \) must commute with time evolution.

- **Commutativity Condition**: For emergence to hold, the following must be true:
  \[
  E_\beta[\Phi(a(t))] = \Phi[E_\alpha(a(t))]
  \]

- **Real Patterns**: Emergent descriptions imply that it is possible to coarse-grain micro states while retaining predictive power at the macro level.

- **Vagueness of Novelty**: The novelty of emergent properties is subjective and can vary based on individual judgment.

- **Importance of Clarity**: The paper aims to clarify the distinctions between different types of emergence without relying on subjective judgments.
