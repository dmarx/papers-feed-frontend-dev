The researchers' decisions regarding the definition and classification of emergence are grounded in a systematic approach to understanding complex systems. Below is a detailed technical explanation of their rationale for each aspect of emergence as presented in the provided text.

### Definition of Emergence
The researchers define emergence as the appearance of novel properties or behaviors in a composite system that cannot be predicted solely from the properties of its individual components. This definition is crucial because it establishes a foundational understanding of emergence as a phenomenon that transcends mere aggregation of parts. It emphasizes that emergent properties arise from interactions and relationships within the system, rather than being inherent to the individual components.

### Micro vs. Macro Descriptions
The distinction between micro (lower-level) and macro (higher-level) descriptions is essential for discussing emergence. The researchers argue that emergence is relevant when both descriptions exist, as they capture different aspects of the system. The micro description provides detailed information about the individual components, while the macro description offers a broader perspective that can reveal patterns and behaviors not evident at the micro level. This duality is fundamental to understanding how complex systems operate and evolve.

### Types of Emergence
The classification of emergence into weak and strong categories serves to clarify the nature of emergent properties:

- **Weak Emergence**: This type suggests that higher-level properties can, in principle, be deduced from lower-level properties. This perspective aligns with a reductionist view, where understanding the micro-level allows for predictions about the macro-level.
  
- **Strong Emergence**: In contrast, strong emergence posits that higher-level properties are fundamentally new and cannot be deduced from lower-level properties. This notion challenges reductionism and suggests that there are aspects of reality that require a distinct ontological framework.

### Epistemic vs. Ontological Emergence
The researchers differentiate between epistemic and ontological emergence to address the nature of emergent properties:

- **Epistemic Emergence**: This concept relates to the knowledge and understanding of a system. Emergent features may depend on the level of knowledge available, indicating that our understanding can shape our perception of emergence.
  
- **Ontological Emergence**: This perspective asserts that emergent properties exist independently of our knowledge and are not reducible to lower-level properties. This distinction is important for discussions about the reality of emergent phenomena and their implications for scientific theories.

### Classification of Emergence
The researchers propose a detailed classification system for emergence, which includes:

- **Type-0 (Featureless) Emergence**: A basic many-to-one mapping from micro to macro theories that commutes with time evolution. This type does not involve subsystems and serves as a foundational concept for understanding emergence.

- **Type-1 (Local) Emergence**: This type involves a many-to-one mapping where macro subsystems are composed of specific micro subsystems. It is further divided into:
  - **Type-1a (Direct) Emergence**: Characterized by algorithmically simple relationships.
  - **Type-1b (Incompressible) Emergence**: Involves algorithmically complex relationships.

- **Type-2 (Nonlocal) Emergence**: Similar to Type-1 but allows for macro entities or dynamics that are defined nonlocally, indicating a more complex relationship between micro and macro levels.

- **Type-3 (Augmented) Emergence**: Introduces new ontological features in the macro theory that are absent in the micro theory, suggesting a significant departure from reductionist views.

### Markovian Evolution
The assumption of Markovian evolution, where future states depend only on the current state, is a critical aspect of the researchers' framework. This assumption simplifies the analysis of dynamic systems and aligns with many contemporary physical theories. It allows for a clear mathematical representation of state evolution, facilitating the exploration of emergence.

### Mathematical Representation
The mathematical representation of state evolution and the emergence relation is crucial for formalizing the concepts discussed. The equations provided illustrate how micro and macro theories evolve over time and how the emergence relation must commute with these evolutions. This formalism is essential for establishing rigorous criteria for emergence.

### Commutativity Condition
The commutativity condition is a key requirement for emergence to hold. It ensures that the emergent properties are consistent with the underlying dynamics of both micro and macro theories. This condition reinforces the idea that emergent phenomena are not arbitrary but are rooted in the relationships between different levels of description.

### Real Patterns
The notion of "real patterns" emphasizes that emergent descriptions can retain predictive power despite coarse-graining micro states. This concept supports the idea that emergent properties are not merely artifacts of our descriptions but have a genuine role in understanding complex systems.

### Vagueness of Novelty
The researchers acknowledge the subjective nature of novelty in emergent properties. By recognizing that the perception of novelty can vary among individuals, they aim to avoid relying on subjective judgments in their classification of emergence. This approach enhances the clarity and objectivity of their framework.

### Importance of Clarity
The researchers emphasize the need for clarity in distinguishing
