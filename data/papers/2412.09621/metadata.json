  "abstract": "Learning to understand dynamic 3D scenes from imagery is crucial for\napplications ranging from robotics to scene reconstruction. Yet, unlike other\nproblems where large-scale supervised training has enabled rapid progress,\ndirectly supervising methods for recovering 3D motion remains challenging due\nto the fundamental difficulty of obtaining ground truth annotations. We present\na system for mining high-quality 4D reconstructions from internet stereoscopic,\nwide-angle videos. Our system fuses and filters the outputs of camera pose\nestimation, stereo depth estimation, and temporal tracking methods into\nhigh-quality dynamic 3D reconstructions. We use this method to generate\nlarge-scale data in the form of world-consistent, pseudo-metric 3D point clouds\nwith long-term motion trajectories. We demonstrate the utility of this data by\ntraining a variant of DUSt3R to predict structure and 3D motion from real-world\nimage pairs, showing that training on our reconstructed data enables\ngeneralization to diverse real-world scenes.
