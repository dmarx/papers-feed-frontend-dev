- **Mathematical Foundations**: Familiarity with linear algebra, multivariate calculus, and probability is essential for understanding machine learning algorithms.
  
- **Key Algorithms**: 
  - **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: A method for optimizing an objective function that is written as a sum of differentiable functions.
  - **ADAM Algorithm**: An extension of SGD that computes adaptive learning rates for each parameter.

- **Convex Optimization**: 
  - **Convex Sets**: A set \( \Omega \) is convex if for any \( x, y \in \Omega \), the line segment connecting \( x \) and \( y \) is also in \( \Omega \).
  - **Convex Functions**: A function \( F \) is convex if for any \( x, y \in \text{dom}(F) \) and \( \lambda \in [0, 1] \):
    \[
    F(\lambda x + (1 - \lambda)y) \leq \lambda F(x) + (1 - \lambda)F(y)
    \]

- **Bias-Variance Dilemma**: Understanding the trade-off between bias (error due to overly simplistic assumptions) and variance (error due to excessive complexity).

- **Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS)**: A framework for analyzing functions in a Hilbert space, crucial for kernel methods in machine learning.

- **Generative Models**: 
  - **Markov Chains**: A stochastic process that undergoes transitions from one state to another on a state space.
  - **Variational Methods**: Techniques for approximating complex distributions, particularly in latent variable models.

- **Graphical Models**: A way to represent the conditional dependencies between random variables using graphs.

- **Concentration Inequalities**: Tools for bounding the probability that a random variable deviates from some value (e.g., its mean).

- **Generalization Bounds**: Theoretical limits on how well a model trained on a finite sample can be expected to perform on unseen data.

- **Notation**: 
  - **Indicator Function**: \( 1_C(x) = 1 \) if \( x \in C \), otherwise \( 0 \).
  - **Euclidean Norm**: For \( x \in \mathbb{R}^d \), \( |x| = \sqrt{(x(1))^2 + \ldots + (x(d))^2} \).

- **Matrix Analysis**: 
  - **Operator Norm**: Defined as \( |A|_{op} = \max\{|Ax| : x \in \mathbb{R}^d, |x| = 1\} \).
  - **Positive Definite Matrices**: A symmetric matrix \( A \) is positive definite if \( x^T A x > 0 \) for all \( x \neq 0 \).

- **Topology**: 
  - **Open and Closed Sets**: A set \( U \) is open if for every point \( x \in U \), there exists \( r > 0 \) such that \( B(x, r) \subset U \).
  - **Compact Sets**: A set is compact if every open cover has a finite subcover.

- **Affine Hull**: The smallest affine subset containing a set \( \Omega \), denoted \( \text{aff}(\Omega) \).

- **Relative Interior**: The interior of a set relative to its affine hull, useful for convex analysis.
