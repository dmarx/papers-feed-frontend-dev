- **Title**: GaussianFormer-2: Probabilistic Gaussian Superposition for Efficient 3D Occupancy Prediction
- **Objective**: Improve 3D semantic occupancy prediction by addressing limitations of existing Gaussian representations.
- **Key Contributions**:
  - Introduces a probabilistic Gaussian superposition model.
  - Achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with only 8.9% of Gaussians compared to previous models.
- **Limitations of Previous Models**:
  - Existing 3D semantic Gaussian representation includes empty regions, leading to inefficiency.
  - Aggregation process results in overlapping Gaussians and unbounded semantic logits.
- **Probabilistic Gaussian Representation**:
  - Models only occupied regions by interpreting Gaussians as probability distributions of occupancy.
  - Uses the multiplication theorem of probability for aggregation, avoiding overlaps.
- **Key Equations**:
  - **Occupancy Prediction**: 
    \[
    \hat{o}(x; G) = \sum_{i=1}^{P} g_i(x; m_i, s_i, r_i, a_i, c_i)
    \]
  - **Gaussian Contribution**:
    \[
    g(x; G) = a \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}(x - m)^T \Sigma^{-1}(x - m)\right) c
    \]
  - **Probability of Occupancy**:
    \[
    \alpha(x; G) = \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}(x - m)^T \Sigma^{-1}(x - m)\right)
    \]
  - **Overall Probability**:
    \[
    \alpha(x) = 1 - \prod_{i=1}^{P} (1 - \alpha(x; G_i))
    \]
  - **Expectation of Semantics**:
    \[
    e(x; G) = \sum_{i=1}^{P} p(G_i | x) c_i
    \]
- **Initialization Module**: 
  - Distribution-based initialization to effectively position Gaussians around occupied areas.
- **Datasets Used**: 
  - nuScenes and KITTI-360 for evaluation of performance.
- **Results**: 
  - GaussianFormer-2 outperforms existing methods with high efficiency and realistic scene perception.
- **Applications**: 
  - Autonomous driving, 4D occupancy forecasting, self-supervised 3D scene understanding.
