  "abstract": "3D semantic occupancy prediction is an important task for robust\nvision-centric autonomous driving, which predicts fine-grained geometry and\nsemantics of the surrounding scene. Most existing methods leverage dense\ngrid-based scene representations, overlooking the spatial sparsity of the\ndriving scenes. Although 3D semantic Gaussian serves as an object-centric\nsparse alternative, most of the Gaussians still describe the empty region with\nlow efficiency. To address this, we propose a probabilistic Gaussian\nsuperposition model which interprets each Gaussian as a probability\ndistribution of its neighborhood being occupied and conforms to probabilistic\nmultiplication to derive the overall geometry. Furthermore, we adopt the exact\nGaussian mixture model for semantics calculation to avoid unnecessary\noverlapping of Gaussians. To effectively initialize Gaussians in non-empty\nregion, we design a distribution-based initialization module which learns the\npixel-aligned occupancy distribution instead of the depth of surfaces. We\nconduct extensive experiments on nuScenes and KITTI-360 datasets and our\nGaussianFormer-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.\nCode: https://github.com/huang-yh/GaussianFormer.",
