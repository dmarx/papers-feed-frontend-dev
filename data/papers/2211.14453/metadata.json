  "abstract": "Spectral analysis provides one of the most effective paradigms for\ninformation-preserving dimensionality reduction, as simple descriptions of\nnaturally occurring signals are often obtained via few terms of periodic basis\nfunctions. In this work, we study deep neural networks designed to harness the\nstructure in frequency domain for efficient learning of long-range correlations\nin space or time: frequency-domain models (FDMs). Existing FDMs are based on\ncomplex-valued transforms i.e. Fourier Transforms (FT), and layers that perform\ncomputation on the spectrum and input data separately. This design introduces\nconsiderable computational overhead: for each layer, a forward and inverse FT.\nInstead, this work introduces a blueprint for frequency domain learning through\na single transform: transform once (T1). To enable efficient, direct learning\nin the frequency domain we derive a variance-preserving weight initialization\nscheme and investigate methods for frequency selection in reduced-order FDMs.\nOur results noticeably streamline the design process of FDMs, pruning redundant\ntransforms, and leading to speedups of 3x to 10x that increase with data\nresolution and model size. We perform extensive experiments on learning the\nsolution operator of spatio-temporal dynamics, including incompressible\nNavier-Stokes, turbulent flows around airfoils and high-resolution video of\nsmoke. T1 models improve on the test performance of FDMs while requiring\nsignificantly less computation (5 hours instead of 32 for our large-scale\nexperiment), with over 20% reduction in average predictive error across tasks.",
