  "abstract": "Transformers have emerged as the architecture of choice for many\nstate-of-the-art AI models, showcasing exceptional performance across a wide\nrange of AI applications. However, the memory demands imposed by Transformers\nlimit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby posing challenges in\nutilizing videos, actions, and other long-form sequences and modalities in\ncomplex environments. We present a novel approach, Ring Attention with\nBlockwise Transformers (Ring Attention), which leverages blockwise computation\nof self-attention and feedforward to distribute long sequences across multiple\ndevices while fully overlapping the communication of key-value blocks with the\ncomputation of blockwise attention. Our approach enables training and inference\nof sequences that are up to device count times longer than those achievable by\nprior memory-efficient Transformers, without resorting to approximations or\nincurring additional communication and computation overheads. Extensive\nexperiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach in allowing millions of tokens context size\nand improving performance.",
