- **Objective**: Explore the potential of AI systems, specifically AlphaZero (AZ), to teach humans new chess concepts that extend beyond existing human knowledge.
  
- **Key Hypothesis**: The knowledge gap (M - H) exists, where M represents machine knowledge and H represents human knowledge, and this gap can be bridged to empower human experts.

- **Methodology Overview**:
  - **Concept Discovery**: Develop a method to extract unsupervised concepts from AZ's latent space using its policy value network and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).
  - **Novelty Assurance**: Use spectral analysis to ensure discovered concepts are unique to AZ's games compared to human games.
  - **Teachability Metric**: Introduce a metric to evaluate the teachability of concepts to AI agents with no prior knowledge.

- **Chess as a Domain**: Chess serves as an ideal domain due to its long history of knowledge development and the ability to quantitatively measure play quality using Elo ratings.

- **Findings**:
  - **Improvement in Grandmasters**: Four top chess grandmasters showed significant improvement in identifying concept-based moves after exposure to AZ's strategies.
  - **Understanding of AZ's Plans**: Qualitative feedback from grandmasters indicated a deeper understanding and appreciation of AZ's unique strategies.

- **Conceptual Framework**:
  - **Representational Spaces**: Define H (human knowledge) and M (machine knowledge) and their intersections (M âˆ© H) and differences (M - H).
  - **Vygotsky's Theory**: Concepts from (M - H) may fall within the 'proximal zone of development' for human learners, facilitating learning with guidance.

- **Framework Structure**:
  - **Section 3**: Definition and operationalization of concepts.
  - **Section 4**: Method for finding and filtering concepts to ensure they are informative, teachable, and novel.
  - **Section 5**: Efficacy of the method on supervised concepts.
  - **Section 6**: Human experiment protocols and results demonstrating the bridging of the (M - H) gap.

- **Implications**: The findings suggest that AI systems like AZ can not only outperform humans but also serve as valuable teaching tools, potentially transforming human expertise across various domains.

- **Future Work**: Explore limitations and further applications of the proposed framework in other fields beyond chess.
