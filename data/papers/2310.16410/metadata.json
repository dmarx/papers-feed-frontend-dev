  "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have made remarkable progress, attaining\nsuper-human performance across various domains. This presents us with an\nopportunity to further human knowledge and improve human expert performance by\nleveraging the hidden knowledge encoded within these highly performant AI\nsystems. Yet, this knowledge is often hard to extract, and may be hard to\nunderstand or learn from. Here, we show that this is possible by proposing a\nnew method that allows us to extract new chess concepts in AlphaZero, an AI\nsystem that mastered the game of chess via self-play without human supervision.\nOur analysis indicates that AlphaZero may encode knowledge that extends beyond\nthe existing human knowledge, but knowledge that is ultimately not beyond human\ngrasp, and can be successfully learned from. In a human study, we show that\nthese concepts are learnable by top human experts, as four top chess\ngrandmasters show improvements in solving the presented concept prototype\npositions. This marks an important first milestone in advancing the frontier of\nhuman knowledge by leveraging AI; a development that could bear profound\nimplications and help us shape how we interact with AI systems across many AI\napplications.",
