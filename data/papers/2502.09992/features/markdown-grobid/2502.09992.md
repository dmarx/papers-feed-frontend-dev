# Large Language Diffusion Models

## Abstract

## 

Autoregressive models (ARMs) are widely regarded as the cornerstone of large language models (LLMs). We challenge this notion by introducing LLaDA, a diffusion model trained from scratch under the pre-training and supervised finetuning (SFT) paradigm. LLaDA models distributions through a forward data masking process and a reverse process, parameterized by a vanilla Transformer to predict masked tokens. By optimizing a likelihood bound, it provides a principled generative approach for probabilistic inference. Across extensive benchmarks, LLaDA demonstrates strong scalability, outperforming our self-constructed ARM baselines. Remarkably, LLaDA 8B is competitive with strong LLMs like LLaMA3 8B in in-context learning and, after SFT, exhibits impressive instruction-following abilities in case studies such as multi-turn dialogue. Moreover, LLaDA addresses the reversal curse, surpassing GPT-4o in a reversal poem completion task. Our findings establish diffusion models as a viable and promising alternative to ARMs, challenging the assumption that key LLM capabilities discussed above are inherently tied to ARMs. Project page and codes: [https: //ml-gsai.github.io/LLaDA-demo/](https://ml-gsai.github.io/LLaDA-demo/).

$max θ E pdata(x) log p θ (x) ⇔ min θ KL(p data (x)||p θ (x))$Generative modeling principles

.

The predominant approach relies on the autoregressive modeling (ARM)-commonly referred to as the next-token prediction paradigm-to define the model distribution:

$p θ (x) = p θ (x 1 ) L i=2 p θ (x i | x 1 , . . . , x i-1 ) Autoregressive formulation , (2$$)$where x is a sequence of length L, and x i is the i-th token.

This paradigm has proven remarkably effective [(Radford, 2018;](#b72)[Radford et al., 2019;](#b73)[Brown, 2020;](#b13)[OpenAI, 2022)](#b66) and has become the foundation of current LLMs. Despite its widespread adoption, a fundamental question remains unanswered: Is the autoregressive paradigm the only viable path to achieving the intelligence exhibited by LLMs?

We argue that the answer is not a simple "yes". The key insight overlooked previously is: it is the generative modeling principles (i.e., Eq. ( [1](#formula_2))), rather than the autoregressive formulation (i.e., Eq. ( [2](#formula_3))) itself, that fundamentally underpin the essential properties of LLMs, as detailed below. However, certain inherent limitations of LLMs can be directly traced to their autoregressive nature.

In particular, we argue that scalability is primarily a consequence of the interplay between Transformers [(Vaswani, 2017)](#b92), model and data size, and Fisher consistency 1 [(Fisher, 1922)](#b28) induced by the generative principles in Eq. ( [1](#formula_2)), rather than a unique result of ARM. The success of diffusion transformers [(Bao et al., 2023;](#b7)[Peebles & Xie, 2023)](#b71) on visual data [(Brooks et al., 2024)](#b12) supports this claim.

Furthermore, the capabilities of instruction-following and in-context learning [(Brown, 2020)](#b13) appear to be intrinsic properties of all proper conditional generative models on structurally consistent linguistic tasks, rather than exclusive advantages of ARMs. In addition, while ARMs can be interpreted as a lossless data compressor [(Deletang et al.;](#b23)[Huang et al., 2024b)](#), any sufficiently expressive probabilistic model can achieve similar capabilities [(Shannon, 1948)](#b80).

Nevertheless, the autoregressive nature of LLMs presents notable challenges. For example, sequential token-by-token generation incurs high computational costs, and the leftto-right modeling limits effectiveness in reversal reasoning tasks [(Berglund et al., 2023)](#b9). These inherent limitations constrain LLMs in handling longer and more complex tasks.

Motivated by these insights, we introduce LLaDA, a Large Language Diffusion with mAsking, to investigate whether the capabilities exhibited by LLMs can emerge from generative modeling principles beyond ARMs in Eq. ( [2](#formula_3)), thereby addressing the fundamental question posed earlier. In contrast to traditional ARMs, LLaDA leverages a masked diffusion model (MDM) [(Austin et al., 2021a;](#)[Lou et al., 2023;](#)[Shi et al., 2024;](#b82)[Sahoo et al., 2024;](#b78)[Ou et al., 2024)](#b68), which incorporates a discrete random masking process and trains a mask predictor to approximate its reverse process. This design enables LLaDA to construct a model distribution with bidirectional dependencies and optimize a lower bound of its log-likelihood, offering an unexplored and principled alternative to existing LLMs.

The core of LLaDA is a mask predictor, a parametric model p θ (•|x t ) that takes x t as input and predicts all masked tokens (denoted M) simultaneously. It is trained using a crossentropy loss computed only on the masked tokens:

$L(θ) ≜ -E t,x0,xt 1 t L i=1 1[x i t = M] log p θ (x i 0 |x t ) ,(3)$where x 0 is sampled from the training data, t is sampled uniformly from [0, 1], and x t is sampled from the forward process. The indicator function 1[•] ensures that the loss is computed only for masked tokens.

Once trained, we can simulate a reverse process (see Sec. induced at t = 0. Notably, the loss in Eq. ( [3](#formula_5)) has been proven to be an upper bound on the negative log-likelihood of the model distribution [(Shi et al., 2024;](#b82)[Ou et al., 2024)](#b68):

$-E pdata(x0) [log p θ (x 0 )] ≤ L(θ),(4)$making it a principled objective for generative modeling.

Notably, LLaDA employs a masking ratio that varies randomly between 0 and 1 while masked language models (Devlin, 2018) use a fixed ratio. The subtly differences have significant implications, especially at scale: as shown in Eq. ( [4](#formula_6)), LLaDA is a principled generative model with the potential to perform in-context learning naturally, akin to LLMs. Moreover, its generative perspective ensures Fisher consistency [(Fisher, 1922)](#b28) in extreme cases, suggesting strong scalability with large data and models.

## Pre-training

LLaDA employs a Transformer [(Vaswani, 2017)](#b92) as the mask predictor, whose architecture is similar to existing LLMs. However, LLaDA does not use a causal mask, as its formulation allows it to see the entire input for predictions.

We trained two variants of LLaDA with different sizes: 1 billion (B) and 8B. We summarize the model architecture of LLaDA 8B and LLaMA3 8B [(Dubey et al., 2024)](#b27) here and details are provided in Appendix B.2. We have ensured consistency in most hyperparameters while making several necessary modifications. We use vanilla multi-head attention instead of grouped query attention [(Ainslie et al., 2023)](#b1) for simplicity, as LLaDA is incompatible with KV caching, resulting in a different number of key and value heads. Consequently, the attention layer has more parameters, and we reduce the FFN dimension to maintain a comparable model size. Additionally, the vocabulary size differs slightly due to a tokenizer [(Brown, 2020)](#b13) adapted on our data.

The LLaDA model is pre-trained on a dataset comprising 2.3 trillion (T) tokens, adhering to a data protocol that aligns closely with existing large language models (LLMs) [(Touvron et al., 2023;](#b90)[Chu et al., 2024)](#b20), without the incorporation of any special techniques. The data are derived from online corpora, with low-quality content filtered through manually designed rules and LLM-based approaches. Beyond general text, the dataset encompasses high-quality code, math, and multilingual data. The mixing of data sources and domains is guided by scaled-down ARMs. The pre-training process utilizes a fixed sequence length of 4096 tokens, incurring a total computational cost of 0.13 million H800 GPU hours, similar to ARMs of the same scale and dataset size.

For a training sequence x 0 , we randomly sample t ∈ [0, 1], mask each token independently with the same probability t to obtain x t (see Fig. [2](#fig_0) (a)) and estimate Eq. (3) via the Monte Carlo method for stochastic gradient descent training. In addition, following [Nie et al. (2024)](#b65), to enhance the ability of LLaDA to handle variable-length data, we set 1% of the pre-training data to a random length that is uniformly sampled from the range [[1,](#)[4096]](#).

We adopted the Warmup-Stable-Decay [(Hu et al., 2024)](#b47) learning rate scheduler to monitor the training progress without interrupting continuous training. Specifically, we linearly increased the learning rate from 0 to 4 × 10 -4 over the first 2000 iterations and maintained it at 4 × 10 -4 . After processing 1.2T tokens, we decayed the learning rate to 1 × 10 -4 and held it constant for the next 0.8T tokens to ensure stable training. Finally, we linearly reduced the learning rate from 1 × 10 -4 to 1 × 10 -5 for the last 0.3T tokens. Furthermore, we utilized the AdamW optimizer [(Loshchilov, 2017)](#b60) with a weight decay of 0.1, a batch size of 1280, and a local batch size of 4 per GPU. The 8B experiment was executed once, without any hyperparameter tuning.

## Supervised Fine-Tuning

We enhance the capability of LLaDA to follow instructions by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with paired data (p 0 , r 0 ), where p 0 is the prompt and r 0 denotes the response. This is the simplest and most basic post-training method for LLMs. Technically, this requires to model the conditional distribution p θ (r 0 |p 0 ) instead of p θ (x 0 ) in pre-training.

The implementation is similar to pre-training. As shown in Fig. [2](#fig_0) (b), we leave the prompt unchanged and mask the tokens in the response independently, as done for x 0 . Then, we feed both the prompt and the masked response r t to the pre-trained mask predictor to compute the loss for SFT:

$-E t,p0,r0,rt   1 t L ′ i=1 1[r i t = M] log p θ (r i 0 |p 0 , r t )   ,(5)$where L ′ denotes a dynamic length specified later, and all other notations remain the same as before.

Note that this approach is fully compatible with pre-training.

Essentially, the concatenation of p 0 and r 0 can be treated as clean pre-training data x 0 , while the concatenation of p 0 and r t serves as the masked version x t . The process is identical to pre-training, with the only difference being that all masked tokens happen to appear in the r 0 portion.

The LLaDA 8B model undergoes SFT on a dataset comprising 4.5 million pairs. Consistent with the pre-training process, both data preparation and training follow the SFT protocols utilized in existing LLMs [(Chu et al., 2024;](#b20)[Yang et al., 2024)](#b100), without introducing any additional techniques to optimize LLaDA's performance. The dataset spans multiple domains, including code, mathematics, instructionfollowing, and structured data understanding. We append |EOS| tokens to the end of short pairs in each mini-batch to ensure equal lengths across all data. We treat |EOS| as a normal token during training and remove it during sampling, enabling LLaDA to control the response length automatically. Please refer to Appendix B.1 for more details.

We train for 3 epochs on the SFT data using a similar schedule to the pre-training phase. The learning rate is linearly increased from 0 to 2.5 × 10 -5 over the first 50 iterations and then kept constant. During the final 10% of iterations, it is linearly reduced to 2.5 × 10 -6 . Additionally, we set the weight decay to 0.1, the global batch size to 256, and the local batch size to 2 per GPU. The SFT experiment was executed once, without any hyperparameter tuning.

## Inference

As a generative model, LLaDA is capable of both sampling new text and evaluating the likelihood of candidate text.

We begin with the sampling. As illustrated in Fig. [2 (c](#fig_0)), given a prompt p 0 , we discretize the reverse process to sample from the model distribution p θ (r 0 |p 0 ), starting from a fully masked response. The total number of sampling steps is a hyperparameter, which naturally provides LLaDA with a trade-off between efficiency and sample quality, as analyzed in Sec. 3.3. We employ uniformly distributed timesteps by default. In addition, the generation length is also treated as a hyperparameter, specifying the length of the fully masked sentence at the beginning of the sampling process. As detailed in Appendix B.4, since both pre-training and SFT are conducted using datasets with variable lengths, the final results are insensitive to this length hyperparameter.

At an intermediate step from time t ∈ (0, 1] to s ∈ [0, t), we feed both p 0 and r t into the mask predictor and predict all masked tokens simultaneously. Subsequently, we remask s t of the predicted tokens in expectation to obtain r s , ensuring that the transition of the reverse process aligns with the forward process for accurate sampling [(Austin et al., 2021a)](#).

In principle, the remasking strategy should be purely random. However, inspired by the annealing tricks of sampling in LLMs [(Holtzman et al., 2019;](#b44)[Brown, 2020)](#b13), we explore two deterministic yet effective remasking strategies. Specifically, similarly to [Chang et al. (2022)](#b15), we remask the s t of predicted tokens with the lowest confidence based on the predictions, called low-confidence remasking. Additionally, for LLaDA after SFT, we can divide the sequence into several blocks and generate them from left to right, called semi-autoregressive remasking. Within each block, we apply the reverse process to perform sampling. We provide more details and ablation studies in Appendix. B.3.

For conditional likelihood evaluation, we can naturally utilize the upper bound in Eq. ( [5](#formula_7)). However, we find that the following equivalent form [(Ou et al., 2024)](#b68) exhibits lower variance and is more stable for evaluation:

$-E l,r0,r l L l L i=1 1[r i l = M] log p θ (r i 0 |p 0 , r l ) , (6$$)$where l is uniformly sampled from {1, 2, . . . , L}, and r l is obtained by uniformly sampling l tokens from r 0 without replacement for masking. In addition, we employ the unsupervised classifier-free guidance [(Nie et al., 2024)](#b65). We refer the readers to more details in Appendix A.2.

We present the training, sampling, and likelihood evaluation algorithms, along with theoretical details, in Appendix A.

## Experiments

We evaluate the scalability, instruction-following, and incontext learning capabilities of LLaDA on standard benchmarks, followed by analyses and case studies on more controlled datasets to provide a comprehensive assessment.

## Scalability of LLaDA on Language Tasks

We first investigate the scalability of LLaDA on downstream tasks in comparison with the ARM baselines we constructed. We evaluate the performance of LLaDA and our ARM baselines trained on the same data across increasing computational FLOPs. LLaDA exhibits strong scalability, matching the overall performance of ARMs on six tasks. Specifically, at the 1B scale, we ensured that LLaDA and ARM shared the same architecture, data, and all other configurations. At larger scales, we also report results for LLaDA and ARM models of slightly different sizes trained on the same data due to resource limit, as detailed in Appendix B.2. We use the computational cost as a unified scaling metric. For evaluation, we focused on six standard and diverse tasks.

As shown in Fig. [3](#fig_1), LLaDA demonstrates impressive scalability, with its overall trend being highly competitive with that of ARM. Notably, in tasks such as MMLU and GSM8K, LLaDA exhibits even stronger scalability. Even on tasks like PIQA, where performance lags, LLaDA narrows the gap with ARMs at larger scales. To account for the significant influence of outliers, we opted not to fit quantitative scaling curves, avoiding potential misinterpretation. Nevertheless, the results clearly demonstrate the scalability of LLaDA. [Nie et al. (2024)](#b65) suggests that MDM requires 16 times more computation than ARM to achieve the same likelihood. However, there are key differences that make the conclusions of this study more broadly applicable. In particular, likelihood is a relatively indirect metric for downstream task performance, and diffusion optimizes a bound of the likelihood, making it not directly comparable to ARM. Additionally, we extended the scaling range from 10 18 ∼ 10 20 in [Nie et al. (2024)](#b65) to 10 20 ∼ 10 23 in this work.

## Benchmark Results

To comprehensively evaluate the in-context learning and instruction-following capabilities of LLaDA 8B, we conducted detailed comparisons with existing LLMs [(Touvron et al., 2023;](#b90)[Dubey et al., 2024;](#b27)[Chu et al., 2024;](#b20)[Yang et al., 2024;](#b100)[Bi et al., 2024;](#b10)[Jiang et al., 2023)](#b50) of similar scale. The selection of tasks and evaluation protocols was aligned with existing studies, encompassing 15 popular benchmarks in general tasks, mathematics, code, and Chinese. Further details are provided in Appendix B.5. For a more direct comparison, we re-evaluated representative LLMs [(Touvron et al., 2023;](#b90)[Dubey et al., 2024)](#b27) in our implementation.

As shown in Tab. 1, after pretraining on 2.3T tokens, LLaDA 8B demonstrates remarkable performance, surpassing LLaMA2 7B on nearly all tasks, and is overall competitive with LLaMA3 8B. LLaDA shows advantages in math and Chinese tasks. We conjecture that the strengths stem from the same factors as its relatively weaker performance in some tasks-differences in data quality and distribution, largely due to the closed-source situation of LLM datasets.

Notably, we have carefully ruled out the possibility of data leakage by taking GSM8K as an example. First, as shown in Fig. [3](#fig_1), LLaDA outperformed ARM baselines regarding GSM8K. Moreover, the conclusion remains on a fully unseen GSM8K-like task [(Ye et al., 2024)](#b103) in Appendix B.7. Further, Tab. 2 compares the performance of LLaDA 8B Instruct with existing LLMs. We observed that SFT improved LLaDA's performance on most downstream tasks. A few metrics, such as MMLU, showed declines, and we conjecture may be due to the suboptimal quality of the SFT data. Overall, since we did not perform alignment with reinforcement learning (RL), our results are slightly behind LLaMA3 8B Instruct, though the gaps in many metrics remain small. Notably, even with only SFT, LLaDA demonstrates impres-   Overall, despite the lack of data transparency, we have made every effort to adopt standardized procedures and introduce diverse tasks, we believe they sufficiently demonstrate the extraordinary capabilities of LLaDA, which is the only competitive non-autoregressive model to our knowledge.

## Reversal Reasoning and Analyses

To quantify the reversal reasoning ability of models [(Berglund et al., 2023)](#b9), we follow the protocol established in Allen-Zhu & Li (2023). Specifically, we construct a dataset of 496 famous Chinese poem sentence pairs. Given a sentence from a poem, models are tasked with generating the subsequent line (forward) or the preceding line (reversal) without additional fine-tuning. Examples can be found in Appendix B.8. This setting provides a straightforward and more realistic evaluation compared to previous studies [(Nie et al., 2024;](#b65)[Kitouni et al., 2024)](#b53).

As shown in Tab. 3, LLaDA effectively addresses the reversal curse [(Berglund et al., 2023)](#b9), demonstrating consistent zero-shot performance across both forward and reversal tasks. In contrast, both Qwen 2.5 and GPT-4o exhibit a significant gap between the two. The results on forward generation confirm that both ARMs are strong, benefiting from significantly larger datasets and greater computational resources than LLaDA. However, LLaDA outperforms both by a large margin in the reversal task.

We emphasize that we did not design anything special for reversal tasks. Intuitively, LLaDA treats tokens uniformly without inductive bias, leading to balanced performance. See more details in Appendix A.2.

We also analyze the effect of remasking strategies and sampling steps, as detailed in Appendix B.3 and Appendix B.6.

## Case Studies

We present samples generated by LLaDA 8B Instruct in Tab. 4, showcasing its instruction-following capabilities. First, the

table illustrates LLaDA's ability to generate coherent, fluent, and extended text in a non-autoregressive manner. Second, it highlights the model's multi-turn dialogue capability, effectively retaining conversation history and producing contextually appropriate responses across multiple languages. Such chat capabilities of LLaDA are impressive, as it departs from conventional ARMs for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. See more case studies on remasking and reasoning tasks in Appendix B.9.

## Related Work

Diffusion models [(Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015;](#b84)[Ho et al., 2020;](#b42)[Song et al., 2020)](#b85) have excelled in visual domains but remain unverified for LLMs despite extensive efforts.

A simple approach is to continuousize text data and apply diffusion models directly [(Li et al., 2022;](#b56)[Gong et al., 2022;](#b31)[Han et al., 2022;](#b37)[Strudel et al., 2022;](#b86)[Chen et al., 2022;](#b18)[Dieleman et al., 2022;](#b26)[Richemond et al., 2022;](#b77)[Wu et al., 2023;](#b97)[Mahabadi et al., 2024;](#b63)[Ye et al., 2023b)](#). Alternatively, some methods model continuous parameters of discrete distributions instead [(Lou & Ermon, 2023;](#)[Graves et al., 2023;](#b34)[Lin et al., 2023;](#b58)[Xue et al., 2024)](#b99). However, scalability remains a challenge, as a 1B parameter model requires 64 times the compute of an ARM to achieve comparable performance [(Gulrajani & Hashimoto, 2024)](#b35).

Another approach replaces continuous diffusion with discrete processes featuring new forward and reverse dynamics [(Austin et al., 2021a)](#), leading to numerous variants [(Hoogeboom et al.,](#) 2021b;a; He et al., 2022; Campbell et al., 2022; Meng et al., 2022; Reid et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022; Kitouni et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023; Ye et al., 2023a; Gat et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024; Sahoo et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2024). Notably, Lou et al. (2023) showed that masked diffusion, as a special case of discrete diffusion, achieves perplexity comparable to or surpassing ARMs at GPT-2 scale. Ou et al. (2024) established fundamental theoretical results, which motivated our model design, training, and inference (see Appendix A). Nie et al. (2024) explored how MDM can be leveraged for language tasks such as question answering at GPT-2 scale. Gong et al. (2024) fine-tune ARMs in the MDM formulation. However, improvements are confined to certain metrics, and it remains unclear whether this approach can yield a foundation model comparable to strong LLMs under a comprehensive evaluation.

In comparison, this study scales MDM to an unprecedented size of 8B parameters from scratch, achieving performance comparable to leading LLMs such as LLaMA 3.

Additionally, a parallel line of work on image generation [(Chang et al., 2022;](#b15)[2023)](#) aligns well with the application of MDMs to text data. Moreover, MDMs have also shown promise in domains such as protein generation [(Wang et al., 2024b;](#)[c)](#b80), where they have achieved promising results. Notably, [Kou et al. (2024)](#b54); [Xu et al. (2025)](#b98) demonstrate the potential of using distillation to accelerate MDMs sampling, further enhancing their efficiency.

## Conclusion and Discussion

In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity. placeholder,placeholder,placeh-Albert Einstein

We introduce LLaDA, a principled and previously unexplored approach to large language modeling based on diffusion models. LLaDA demonstrates strong capabilities in scalability, in-context learning, and instruction-following, achieving performance comparable to strong LLMs. In addition, LLaDA offers unique advantages such as bidirectional modeling and enhanced robustness, effectively addressing several inherent limitations of existing LLMs. Our findings not only establish diffusion models as a viable and promising alternative but also challenge the prevailing assumption that these essential capabilities are inherently tied to ARMs.

While promising, the full potential of diffusion models re-mains to be fully explored. Several limitations of this work present significant opportunities for future research.

Due to computational constraints, direct comparisons between LLaDA and ARMs-such as training on identical datasets-were restricted to a computational budget of less than 10 23 FLOPs. To allocate resources for training the largest possible LLaDA model and showcasing its potential, we were unable to scale the ARM baseline to the same extent. Moreover, no specialized attention mechanisms or position embeddings were designed for LLaDA, nor were any system-level architectural optimizations applied.

On the inference side, our exploration of guidance mechanisms [(Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021;](#b25)[Ho & Salimans, 2022)](#b41) remains preliminary, and LLaDA currently exhibits sensitivity to inference hyperparameters. Furthermore, LLaDA has yet to undergo alignment with reinforcement learning [(Ouyang et al., 2022;](#b69)[Rafailov et al., 2024)](#b74), which is crucial for improving its performance and alignment with human intent.

Looking forward, the scale of LLaDA is still smaller than leading counterparts [(Achiam et al., 2023;](#b0)[Dubey et al., 2024;](#b27)[Google, 2024;](#)[Anthropic, 2024;](#b4)[Yang et al., 2024;](#b100)[Liu et al., 2024)](#b59), highlighting the need for further scaling to fully assess its capabilities. In addition, LLaDA's ability to handle multi-modal data remains unexplored. The impact of LLaDA on prompt tuning techniques [(Wei et al., 2022)](#b96) and its integration into agent-based systems [(Park et al., 2023;](#b70)[Wang et al., 2024a](#)) is yet to be fully understood. Finally, a systematic investigation into post-training for LLaDA could facilitate the development of O1-like systems [(OpenAI, 2024;](#b67)[Guo et al., 2025)](#b36).

## Impact Statement

This work challenges the prevailing dominance of autoregressive modeling in LLMs by proposing a diffusion-based alternative. Our findings open new avenues for exploring alternative probabilistic paradigms in natural language processing, with potential applications in conversational AI, code generation, and complex reasoning tasks.

However, diffusion-based models, like traditional LLMs, raise similar societal concerns. These include the environmental impact of large-scale training, the potential misuse for generating harmful or misleading content, and the amplification of biases present in training data. Addressing these challenges is critical to ensuring the responsible development and deployment of diffusion-based language models.

At t = 1, all tokens are guaranteed to be masked, meaning that x 1 follows a Dirac distribution concentrated on a sequence of fully masked tokens. Notably, the linear masking probability is analogous to but distinct from, the noise schedule in continuous diffusion models [(Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015;](#b84)[Ho et al., 2020;](#b42)[Song et al., 2020)](#b85). This linearity is motivated by the assumption that the information in the text is proportional to the number of tokens on average, making it reasonable to lose information linearly during the forward process.

The forward process is not only reversible but also corresponds to a reverse process that is fully factorized across all tokens [(Austin et al., 2021a)](#). The reverse process, from time t = 1 to 0, generates new data from sequences of fully masked tokens. The conditional distribution for the reverse process, for 0 ≤ s < t ≤ 1, is factorized as:

$q s|t (x s |x t ) = L i=1 q s|t (x i s |x t ),(9)$where the conditional distribution for each token is:

$q s|t (x i s |x t ) =          1, x i t ̸ = M, x i s = x i t , s t , x i t = M, x i s = M, t-s t q 0|t (x i s |x t ), x i t = M, x i s ̸ = M, 0, otherwise.(10)$Thus, the key function to estimate is the conditional distribution q 0|t (x i s |x t ), which predicts the original token if it is masked in the input x t . This is analogous to the data prediction form in continuous diffusion models.

As proven in [(Ou et al., 2024)](#b68), an equivalent yet time-free parameterization can be derived as:

$q 0|t (x i s |x t ) = p data (x i 0 |x UM t ), ∀i such that x i t = M,(11)$where x UM t denotes the collection of unmasked tokens in x t , which is identical to the corresponding tokens in the original data x 0 since unmasked tokens are solely determined by x 0 and are independent of time t. Intuitively, this implies that estimating the data prediction function is equivalent to estimating the conditional distributions on clean data, which is time-invariant. Consequently, the time t need not be provided as input to the parametric model.

Although the development of masked diffusion is nontrivial, the implementation is straightforward. We first introduce the mask predictor, a parametric model p θ (•|x t ) (e.g., a Transformer without a causal mask), which takes x t for any t as input and predict all masked tokens simultaneously. Then, we define the model distribution p θ (x 0 ) as follows: starting with x 1 as a sequence of fully masked tokens, we simulate an approximate reverse process parameterized by p θ (•|x t ) from t = 1 to 0. The marginal distribution induced at t = 0 then represents the model distribution p θ (x 0 ). In addition, for n-turn dialogues (p 0 0 , r 0 0 , p 1 0 , r 1 0 , . . . , p n-1 0 , r n-1 0

), we treat it as n single-turn dialogue pairs, i.e., (p 0 0 , r 0 0 ), (p 0 0 r 0 0 p 1 0 , r 1 0 ), . . . , (p 0 0 r 0 0 p 1 0 r 1 0 . . . p n-1 0 , r n-1

## 0

) and randomly sample one. This data partitioning strategy not only equips LLaDA with multi-turn dialogue capabilities but also aligns with the padding strategy.

## B.2. Architectures and Scaling Experiments

This section provides detailed information about the models we trained and the scalability experiments described in Sec. 3.1.

Firstly, for efficiency, we trained an ARM and a MDM, both with 1.5B parameters and identical architectures. Additionally, we scaled the MDM to 8B parameters. Due to computational resource constraints, we did not train an 8B autoregressive model with the same architecture. Instead, we utilized our previously trained 7B autoregressive model for comparison. These four models are utilized in the scalability analysis in Sec. 3.1. We adopted a Transformer architecture similar to LLaMA [(Touvron et al., 2023;](#b90)[Dubey et al., 2024)](#b27) for the ARMs and MDMs we trained. Specifically, we employ RMSNorm [(Zhang & Sennrich, 2019)](#b105) to stabilize training, used SwiGLU [(Shazeer, 2020)](#b81) as the activation function to enhance non-linearity, and integrate RoPE [(Su et al., 2024)](#b87) for more expressive positional encoding. Tab. 5 provides an overview of the model architectures.

Additionally, we employ the widely used 6N D formulation [(Kaplan et al., 2020;](#b51)[Hoffmann et al., 2022)](#b43) to calculate the training FLOPs in Fig. [3](#fig_1), where N represents the number of non-embedding parameters, and D denotes the total number of training tokens.

## B.3. Details and Ablation on Remasking

This section first explains the inference methods in detail, followed by ablation studies on various remasking strategies.

For instruct model, since our training includes a large number of |EOS| tokens, directly applying the lowest confidence remasking strategy would result in an excessively high and unnatural occurrence of |EOS| tokens in the generated sentences. Therefore, we divide the entire generation length into several blocks. Each block is generated from left to right, and within each block, we apply the reverse process to perform sampling. However, for the base model, since |EOS| tokens are not padded during training, using the semi-autoregressive remasking strategy makes little difference in the results. For efficiency, we set the answer length to 512 and the number of sampling steps to 256 in our ablation studies. For the semi-autoregressive remasking strategy, we set the block length to 32. To simplify the evaluation, we use GSM8K accuracy as the performance metric. As shown in Table [6](#tab_7), for the base model, applying the lowest confidence remasking strategy significantly improves performance, whereas the semi-autoregressive remasking strategy does not yield any noticeable benefits. In contrast, for the instruct model, directly applying the lowest confidence remasking strategy leads to a substantial performance drop. However, combining the lowest confidence remasking strategy with the semi-autoregressive remasking strategy results in the best performance for the instruct model.

We provide the specific remasking strategies and hyperparameters used for each benchmark in Appendix B.5.

## B.4. Ablation on Generated Length

In this section, we conduct ablation studies on the generated length. For simplicity, we use GSM8K as the evaluation metric.

To ensure efficiency and fairness, for each setting, we set the number of sampling steps to half of the generated length, ensuring that in each sampling step, two tokens are transferred from the mask to the text.

For the LLaDA 8B Base model, we employ the lowest-confidence remasking strategy (i.e., Algorithm 5). For the LLaDA 8B Instruct model, we adopt semi-autoregressive sampling with a block length of 32.

As reported in Tab. 7, both the Base model and the Instruct model exhibit minimal sensitivity to the length hyperparameter.

## B.5. Standard Benchmarks and Evaluation

In this section, we briefly introduce the benchmarks used in our study and describe the details of our evaluation process.

Following standard LLM [(Chu et al., 2024;](#b20)[Yang et al., 2024)](#b100) evaluation practices, we assess LLaDA across four dimensions:

General ability: MMLU [(Hendrycks et al., 2020)](#b39), BBH [(Suzgun et al., 2022)](#b89), ARC-C [(Clark et al., 2018)](#b21), Hellaswag [(Zellers et al., 2019)](#b104), TruthfulQA [(Lin et al., 2021)](#b57), WinoGrande [(Sakaguchi et al., 2021)](#b79) and PIQA [(Bisk et al., 2020)](#b11).

Math and science ability: GSM8K [(Cobbe et al., 2021)](#b22), Math [(Hendrycks et al., 2021)](#b40) and GPQA [(Rein et al., 2023)](#b76).

Code generation: HumanEval [(Chen et al., 2021)](#b17), HumanEval-FIM [(Bavarian et al., 2022)](#b8) and MBPP [(Austin et al., 2021b)](#).

Chinese understanding: CMMLU [(Li et al., 2023)](#b55) and C-Eval [(Huang et al., 2024a)](#).

For all the aforementioned benchmarks, we follow the widely adopted evaluation process [(Gao et al., 2024)](#) used in LLM assessments, primarily employing conditional likelihood estimation and conditional generation. Specifically, for certain benchmarks, a prompt and multiple candidate answers are provided, and the model is required to compute each candidate's Table [8](#). Inference Configuration for LLaDA 8B Instruct. We apply the low-confidence remasking strategy across all datasets. A block length smaller than the answer length indicates the use of the semi-autoregressive remasking strategy; otherwise, it is not applied. The shorter answer lengths for MMLU and HellaSwag result from their requirement to generate only a single token (i.e., A, B, C, or D) and two special end tokens (i.e., end of the model response and end of the sentence).

Notably, the padding |EOS| tokens are treated as part of the response, i.e., masked and included in the training objective. The |EOS| tokens are removed from the generated outputs during sampling. This strategy is crucial for LLaDA and ensures that the model learns to control the length of its responses by generating |EOS|, enabling the response length to align effectively with the given prompt.]()
