- **LLaDA Overview**: Introduces a diffusion model trained from scratch, challenging the dominance of autoregressive models (ARMs) in large language models (LLMs).
  
- **Generative Modeling Principles**: 
  - Objective: Maximize likelihood via:
    \[
    \max_\theta E_{p_{\text{data}}(x)} \log p_\theta(x) \quad \text{or} \quad \min_\theta KL(p_{\text{data}}(x) || p_\theta(x))
    \]
  - Autoregressive formulation:
    \[
    p_\theta(x) = p_\theta(x_1) \prod_{i=2}^{L} p_\theta(x_i | x_1, \ldots, x_{i-1})
    \]

- **LLaDA Architecture**: 
  - Utilizes a Transformer without causal masking, allowing full input visibility for predictions.
  - Variants: 1B and 8B parameters, trained on 2.3 trillion tokens.

- **Mask Predictor**: 
  - Predicts masked tokens using:
    \[
    L(\theta) \approx -E_{t,x_0,x_t} \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{L} 1[x_i^t = M] \log p_\theta(x_i^0 | x_t) \right]
    \]
  - Loss is an upper bound on negative log-likelihood:
    \[
    -E_{p_{\text{data}}(x_0)} [\log p_\theta(x_0)] \leq L(\theta)
    \]

- **Pre-training Process**: 
  - Fixed sequence length of 4096 tokens, using a Warmup-Stable-Decay learning rate scheduler.
  - Computational cost: 0.13 million H800 GPU hours.

- **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**: 
  - Conditional distribution modeled as:
    \[
    p_\theta(r_0 | p_0)
    \]
  - Trained on 4.5 million prompt-response pairs, maintaining compatibility with pre-training.

- **Inference Mechanism**: 
  - Sampling from model distribution:
    \[
    p_\theta(r_0 | p_0)
    \]
  - Utilizes a remasking strategy during sampling to ensure alignment with the forward process.

- **Performance Benchmarks**: 
  - LLaDA 8B shows competitive performance with LLaMA3 8B in in-context learning and instruction-following tasks.
  - Surpasses GPT-4o in reversal poem completion tasks.

- **Key Insights**: 
  - Scalability and capabilities of LLMs are tied to generative modeling principles rather than solely ARMs.
  - LLaDA addresses limitations of ARMs, such as high computational costs and constraints in handling complex tasks.
