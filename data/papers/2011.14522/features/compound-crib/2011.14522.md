The research you provided delves into the intricate dynamics of deep neural networks, particularly focusing on the behavior of these networks as their width approaches infinity. Below is a detailed technical explanation and justification for the researchers' decisions regarding the various concepts and methodologies discussed in the paper.

### Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)

The NTK framework provides a powerful tool for understanding the training dynamics of deep neural networks in the infinite-width limit. However, the researchers highlight a critical limitation: while NTK describes the behavior of networks under gradient descent, it does not facilitate feature learning. This is a significant drawback, especially for applications like pretraining and transfer learning, where the ability to learn meaningful representations is crucial. The researchers argue that the standard and NTK parametrizations fail to capture the necessary dynamics for feature learning, which is essential for tasks such as those performed by BERT.

### Feature Learning

Feature learning is a cornerstone of modern deep learning, enabling models to extract relevant patterns from data. The researchers emphasize that the inability of NTK and standard parametrizations to learn features in the infinite-width limit is a fundamental limitation. This observation is backed by empirical results showing that these parametrizations yield embeddings that do not evolve meaningfully, thus failing to capture the underlying structure of the data.

### Maximal Update Parametrization (µP)

To address the limitations of NTK and standard parametrizations, the researchers propose the Maximal Update Parametrization (µP). This parametrization is designed to maximize feature learning by allowing each parameter to be updated optimally without leading to instability or blowup during training. The specific choices of parameters (e.g., \( a_1 = -1/2 \), \( a_{L+1} = 1/2 \), \( b_l = 1/2 \)) are carefully crafted to ensure that the learning dynamics remain stable while promoting effective feature learning. This approach contrasts with the NTK parametrization, which restricts learning rates and leads to kernel dynamics rather than feature learning.

### Dynamical Dichotomy Theorem

The Dynamical Dichotomy Theorem is a pivotal result in the paper, establishing that any nontrivial stable abc-parametrization can yield either feature learning limits or kernel limits, but not both. This theorem underscores the trade-off inherent in neural network parametrizations and provides a theoretical foundation for the researchers' focus on developing parametrizations that can achieve feature learning. The dichotomy is crucial for understanding the implications of different parametrizations on the learning dynamics of neural networks.

### Tensor Programs Technique

The Tensor Programs technique is a novel approach introduced by the researchers to derive the infinite-width limits of neural networks. By expressing neural computations as Tensor Programs and applying the Master Theorem, the researchers can systematically analyze the behavior of networks under various parametrizations. This method allows for rigorous derivation of limits and provides a framework for understanding how different parametrizations affect learning dynamics. The use of Tensor Programs is a significant methodological advancement, enabling the researchers to compute limits that were previously difficult to analyze.

### Empirical Results

The empirical results presented in the paper demonstrate the effectiveness of the µP limits in outperforming both NTK baselines and finite-width networks on tasks like Word2Vec and few-shot learning on Omniglot via MAML. These results validate the theoretical claims made about the advantages of the µP parametrization and highlight its practical applicability in real-world tasks that require robust feature learning.

### Parameter Initialization

The initialization of parameters is a critical aspect of training deep neural networks. The researchers specify that for abc-parametrizations, weights should be initialized as \( w_l \sim N(0, n^{-2b_l}) \). This choice is essential for ensuring stability during training and facilitating effective feature learning. Proper initialization helps prevent issues such as vanishing or exploding gradients, which can hinder the training process.

### Learning Rate Dynamics

The learning rate dynamics are carefully considered in the paper, with the researchers emphasizing the importance of choosing an appropriate learning rate \( \eta n^{-c} \). They argue that a learning rate that is too small leads to trivial dynamics, while one that is too large can cause instability. This balance is crucial for achieving meaningful learning outcomes and is a key consideration in the design of the µP.

### Feature Learning Limit vs. Kernel Limit

The distinction between feature learning limits and kernel limits is central to the researchers' argument. They define a feature learning limit as one where the embedding \( x_L(\xi) \) evolves meaningfully, in contrast to a kernel limit where dynamics are governed by kernel gradient descent. This distinction is critical for understanding the implications of different parametrizations on the learning capabilities of neural networks.

### Comparison with Mean Field Limits

The researchers note that the µP limit is equivalent to the mean field limit for 1-hidden-layer MLPs, with differences primarily in initialization schemes. This comparison highlights the robustness of the µP approach and situates it within the broader context of existing theoretical frameworks for understanding neural network dynamics.

### Conclusion

In summary, the researchers' decisions regarding the various aspects of
