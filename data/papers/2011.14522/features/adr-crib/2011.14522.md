The decisions made by the researchers in the study of feature learning in infinite-width neural networks are grounded in a combination of theoretical insights, empirical observations, and practical considerations. Below is a detailed technical explanation and rationale for each of the key decisions outlined in your request:

### 1. Decision to Focus on Infinite-Width Neural Networks
The focus on infinite-width neural networks stems from the observation that as the width of a neural network increases, its behavior under gradient descent becomes more predictable and can be described by the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). This simplification allows researchers to analyze the training dynamics and generalization properties of neural networks in a more tractable manner. The infinite-width limit serves as a theoretical foundation for understanding how neural networks learn and generalize, which is crucial for advancing the field.

### 2. Choice of Standard and NTK Parametrizations as Baseline Models
The standard parametrization (SP) and NTK parametrization are chosen as baseline models because they represent widely used configurations in the literature. The NTK parametrization, in particular, has been instrumental in providing insights into the training dynamics of neural networks. By comparing their proposed modifications against these established baselines, the researchers can effectively demonstrate the advantages of their new approaches in terms of feature learning capabilities.

### 3. Modification of Standard Parametrization for Feature Learning
The researchers modify the standard parametrization to enable feature learning in the infinite-width limit. This decision is motivated by the realization that the standard and NTK parametrizations do not support feature learning, which is essential for tasks like pretraining and transfer learning. By introducing modifications, they aim to create a framework that allows neural networks to learn meaningful representations, thereby enhancing their practical applicability.

### 4. Adoption of Tensor Programs Technique for Deriving Limits
The Tensor Programs technique is adopted because it provides a systematic way to derive the infinite-width limits of neural networks. This approach allows for the rigorous computation of limits by expressing neural network computations as compositions of matrix multiplications and nonlinearities. The researchers leverage this technique to obtain explicit formulas for the limits of their proposed parametrizations, ensuring that their theoretical claims are well-founded.

### 5. Selection of Word2Vec and Omniglot as Experimental Tasks
Word2Vec and Omniglot are selected as experimental tasks because they are canonical benchmarks that emphasize the importance of feature learning. Word2Vec focuses on learning word embeddings in an unsupervised manner, while Omniglot is a well-known few-shot learning task. By demonstrating the effectiveness of their proposed methods on these tasks, the researchers can showcase the practical benefits of their theoretical contributions.

### 6. Definition and Introduction of abc-Parametrizations
The abc-parametrizations are introduced to classify a natural space of neural network parametrizations that generalize existing models. This classification allows for a systematic exploration of how different parametrizations affect learning dynamics and feature learning capabilities. By defining this framework, the researchers can analyze the trade-offs between stability and feature learning in a structured manner.

### 7. Establishment of the Dynamical Dichotomy Theorem
The Dynamical Dichotomy theorem is established to formalize the relationship between learning dynamics and feature learning capabilities. This theorem states that any nontrivial stable abc-parametrization yields either feature learning or kernel limits, but not both. This insight is crucial for understanding the limitations of existing parametrizations and guiding the design of new ones that can achieve both goals.

### 8. Proposal of the Maximal Update Parametrization (µP)
The Maximal Update Parametrization (µP) is proposed to maximize feature learning while avoiding instability during training. This parametrization is designed to allow for maximal updates of parameters without leading to blowup, thus enabling effective learning dynamics. The decision to propose µP is driven by the need to overcome the limitations of the standard and NTK parametrizations in terms of feature learning.

### 9. Verification of Max Learning Rate Predictions
The researchers verify their predictions regarding the maximum learning rate for different parametrizations through empirical experiments. This verification is essential to establish the practical relevance of their theoretical claims and to demonstrate that the proposed µP can indeed support higher learning rates conducive to effective training.

### 10. Use of Empirical Results to Validate Theoretical Claims
Empirical validation of theoretical claims is a cornerstone of scientific research. By conducting experiments that align with their theoretical predictions, the researchers strengthen the credibility of their findings and provide evidence that their proposed modifications lead to improved performance in feature learning tasks.

### 11. Comparison of µP Limits with NTK and Finite-Width Networks
The comparison of µP limits with NTK and finite-width networks is crucial for illustrating the advantages of the proposed parametrization. By demonstrating that µP outperforms both baselines, the researchers can effectively argue for the utility of their approach in practical applications.
