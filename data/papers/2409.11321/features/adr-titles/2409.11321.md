- Decision to establish a formal connection between Shampoo and Adafactor
- Choice of using the 1/2 power in Shampoo implementation
- Design decision to create SOAP as a combination of Shampoo and Adam
- Selection of preconditioning frequency as the sole additional hyperparameter
- Decision to continually update the running average of the second moment
- Choice of empirical evaluation on language model pre-training with specific model sizes
- Decision to compare SOAP against AdamW and Shampoo in experiments
- Choice of using DistributedShampoo implementation for empirical results
- Decision to focus on computational efficiency improvements in SOAP
- Assumption regarding the performance degradation with less frequent eigendecomposition
- Decision to explore the broader design space for combining first and second-order methods
- Choice to document the robustness of SOAP to large preconditioning frequency
- Decision to include ablation studies on preconditioning frequency and batch size
- Choice to analyze the space and time complexity of SOAP
- Decision to synthesize ideas from prior works in the design of SOAP
- Assumption about the necessity of reducing the number of hyperparameters compared to Shampoo
