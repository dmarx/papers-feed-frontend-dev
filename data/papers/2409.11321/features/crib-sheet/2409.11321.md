- **Key Contribution**: Introduction of SOAP (ShampoO with Adam in the Preconditioner's eigenbasis), which combines Shampoo's preconditioning with Adam's efficiency.
  
- **Equivalence**: SOAP is equivalent to running Adafactor in the eigenbasis of Shampoo's preconditioner, establishing a formal connection between these optimization methods.

- **Performance Metrics**: 
  - SOAP reduces the number of iterations by over 40% and wall clock time by over 35% compared to AdamW.
  - Approximately 20% improvements in both metrics compared to Shampoo.

- **Hyperparameters**: SOAP introduces only one additional hyperparameter (preconditioning frequency) compared to Adam, simplifying the tuning process.

- **Eigendecomposition**: The performance of Shampoo degrades when eigendecomposition is computed less frequently; SOAP mitigates this by continually updating the running average of the second moment.

- **Algorithm Updates**:
  - **Shampoo Update Rule**:
    \[
    L_t \leftarrow L_{t-1} + G_t G_t^T; \quad R_t \leftarrow R_{t-1} + G_t^T G_t; \quad W_t \leftarrow W_{t-1} - \eta L_t^{-1/4} G_t R_t^{-1/4}
    \]
  - **Adafactor Update Rule**:
    \[
    W_t \leftarrow W_{t-1} - \eta M_t V'_t
    \]

- **Notation**:
  - \( W \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n} \): Weight matrix.
  - \( G \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n} \): Gradient matrix.
  - \( H \in \mathbb{R}^{mn \times mn} \): Preconditioner.
  - \( g_t = \text{vec}(G_t) \): Vectorized gradient.

- **Empirical Evaluation**: SOAP was empirically evaluated on language model pre-training with models of sizes 360m and 660m.

- **Computational Efficiency**: SOAP's design aims to improve computational efficiency while maintaining the benefits of second-order methods.

- **Related Works**: 
  - Comparison with KFAC and E-KFAC, highlighting differences in preconditioning approaches.
  - Discussion of prior works on Shampoo and Adafactor, emphasizing the novelty of SOAP's systematic evaluation.

- **Implementation**: Available at [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/nikhilvyas/SOAP).

- **Future Work**: Exploration of SOAP's performance against other non-diagonal preconditioners and further optimization strategies.
