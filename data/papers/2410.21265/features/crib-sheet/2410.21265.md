- **Modular Dualization Concept**: A theoretical framework for constructing duality maps in neural networks, enhancing training algorithms to be fast and scalable.

- **Key Steps in Modular Dualization**:
  1. Assign operator norms to individual layers based on semantics.
  2. Construct duality maps for individual layers using these norms.
  3. Induce a single duality map on the full weight space recursively.

- **Importance of Duality Maps**: They adjust the gradient's size and direction to respect the non-isotropic geometry of the loss function, ensuring proper gradient descent updates.

- **Gradient Update Type Check**:
  - Failed: \( \text{weight} \cdot \text{LR} \cdot \text{weight.grad} \)
  - Passed: \( \text{weight} \cdot \text{LR} \cdot \text{dualize}(\text{weight.grad}) \)

- **Operator Norms**: Assigned to layers to reflect their input-output semantics, crucial for constructing duality maps.

- **GPU-Friendly Algorithms**: Developed for dualizing Embed, Linear, and Conv2D layers, leveraging rectangular Newton-Schulz iteration.

- **Modular Norm**: A norm designed to characterize the heterogeneous curvature of neural architectures, facilitating the construction of well-normed modules.

- **Induced Operator Norm Definition**: For a matrix \( M \) from \( R^{d_{out} \times d_{in}} \):
  \[
  \|M\|_{\alpha \to \beta} = \max_{x \in R^{d_{in}}} \frac{\|Mx\|_{\beta}}{\|x\|_{\alpha}}
  \]

- **Duality Map Examples**:
  - **Euclidean Norm**: \( \text{dualize}_{\|\cdot\|_2}(g) = g \)
  - **Infinity Norm**: \( \text{dualize}_{\|\cdot\|_\infty}(g) = \text{sign}(g) \)

- **RMS to RMS Induced Operator Norm**:
  \[
  \|W\|_{\text{RMS} \to \text{RMS}} = \frac{a_{d_{in}}}{d_{out}} \|W\|_*
  \]
  - Duality map: \( \text{dualize}_{\|\cdot\|_{\text{RMS} \to \text{RMS}}}(G) = \frac{a_{d_{out}}}{d_{in}} U V^T \)

- **Embedding Layer Norm**: 
  \[
  \|W\|_{\ell_1 \to \text{RMS}} = \max_i \| \text{col}_i(W) \|_{\text{RMS}}
  \]
  - Duality map: Normalize each column of \( G \) to unit RMS norm.

- **Comparison with Prior Work**: Modular dualization differs from spectral descent and duality structure gradient descent by leveraging a modular approach and recursive construction, leading to more efficient all-layer optimizers.

- **Applications**: The theory aims to facilitate the design of next-generation optimizers for various neural architectures, potentially improving training speed and scalability.
