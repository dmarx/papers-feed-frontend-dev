<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The problem of comparing probability distributions is at the heart of many tasks in statistics and machine learning. Established comparison methods treat the standard setting that the distributions are supported in the same space. Recently, a new geometric solution has been proposed to address the more challenging problem of comparing measures in Euclidean spaces of differing dimensions. Here, we study the same problem of comparing probability distributions of different dimensions in the tropical setting, which is becoming increasingly relevant in applications involving complex data structures such as phylogenetic trees. Specifically, we construct a Wasserstein distance between measures on different tropical projective tori-the focal metric spaces in both theory and applications of tropical geometry-via tropical mappings between probability measures. We prove equivalence of the directionality of the maps, whether mapping from a low dimensional space to a high dimensional space or vice versa. As an important practical implication, our work provides a framework for comparing probability distributions on the spaces of phylogenetic trees with different leaf sets. We demonstrate the computational feasibility of our approach using existing optimisation techniques on both simulated and real data.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Some of the most immediate and important tasks in statistics and machine learning-such as clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Irpino &amp; Verde, 2008)</ref> and density estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Sheather, 2004</ref>)-require measuring a distance between probability distributions. This is usually done with a notion of distance or divergence between measures; some of the most well-known distances and divergences between probability distributions are the Kullback-Leibler divergence, total variation distance, and Hellinger distance. These notions fall within the class of maps known in probability theory as f -divergences <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Csiszr, 1967)</ref>. More recently, the Wasserstein distance between measures has become increasingly relevant in statistics as it metrises weak convergence of measures and reflects the geometry of the underlying state space (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Panaretos &amp; Zemel, 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>An underlying assumption behind computing f -divergences and Wasserstein distances, however, is that the measures live in the same space. Nevertheless, there exist many application settings where the measures to be compared occur in distinct spaces of different dimensions. For example, phylogenetic trees are used to capture the progression of cancer in a biomedical application or the evolutionary patterns of the spread of disease in a public health application. In such applications, the numbers of leaves in the trees can differ before and after intervention such as treatment or public inoculation, and therefore such datasets will lie on spaces of different dimensions. Existing work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ren et al. (2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Grindstaff &amp; Owen (2019)</ref> study the problem of comparing sets of trees with differing numbers of leaves in BHV tree space <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Billera et al., 2001)</ref>; here, we consider probability measures rather than discrete data sets in tropical tree space <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Speyer &amp; Sturmfels, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>There is an inherent connection between the space of phylogenetic trees and tropical geometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Speyer &amp; Sturmfels, 2004)</ref>, which has recently been exploited to develop many statistical and machine learning tools for sets of phylogenetic trees (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Barnhill et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Tang et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Yoshida et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aliatimis et al., 2024)</ref>. The ambient space of phylogenetic trees as well as Gr√∂bner complexes-central objects in tropical geometry-is the tropical projective torus, which makes it a fundamental space in tropical geometry for both theory and applications. In this work, we therefore study Wasserstein distances between probability distributions on tropical projective tori of different dimensions.</p><p>Our strategy is to leverage recent work in the Euclidean setting by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cai &amp; Lim (2022)</ref>, who construct a Wasserstein distance between Euclidean spaces of different dimensions. The optimal transport problem and thus Wasserstein distances are well defined and have been previously studied on the tropical projective torus by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lee et al. (2022)</ref>. In this work, we build on these existing results and relevant foundations to construct a Wasserstein distance between measures on tropical projective tori of different dimensions. We prove that there need not be a choice of whether to map from the lower dimensional torus to the higher dimensional one or vice versa, because the directional mappings are equivalent.</p><p>The remainder of this manuscript is structured as follows. We begin with an outline of the relevant background and concepts in Section 2. We then characterise the tropical equivalents to the necessary tools in Section 3, which leads to our main theorem and a discussion of practical implications for phylogenetic trees in Section 4. Section 5 consists of numerical experiments for the computation of our proposed distance and a demonstration of our algorithm using real influenza data. We close with a discussion of future work in Section 6.</p><p>Throughout this manuscript we use the term polyhedron to refer to a (possibly unbounded) finite intersection of closed half spaces of dimension d, in accordance with <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ziegler (2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background and Preliminaries</head><p>In this section, we present the tropical setting of our work, the Wasserstein distance definition, and an overview of the approach for mapping between probability distributions of different dimensions in the Euclidean case, which we will closely follow in our work.</p><p>Notation. Throughout this manuscript, we use the notation [n] := {1, 2, . . . , n}.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Essentials of Tropical Algebra and Geometry</head><p>We begin by outlining the basic concepts of tropical algebra and tropical geometry needed for our work; a complete introduction is given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Maclagan &amp; Sturmfels (2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Tropical Algebra and Phylogenetics</head><p>Definition 1 (Tropical Algebra). The tropical algebra is the semiring R = R ‚à™ {-‚àû} with the addition and multiplication operators-tropical addition and tropical multiplication, respectively-given by a ‚äû b = max{a, b}, a ‚äô b = a + b.</p><p>The additive identity is -‚àû and the multiplicative identity is 0. Tropical subtraction is not defined; tropical division is given by classical subtraction.</p><p>Remark 2. Note that <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Maclagan &amp; Sturmfels (2015)</ref> use the min-plus convention where tropical addition is given by the minimum between two elements, rather than the maximum as above. While they are equivalent, we use the max-plus convention as this has been used more frequently in recent applications (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Yoshida et al., 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Yoshida et al., , 2023;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aliatimis et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>Using the tropical algebra, we can define tropical parallels to most algebraic objects. For example, we can define tropical polynomials as the maximum of finitely many linear maps with integer coefficients. Evaluating functions or other mathematical expressions using the tropical algebra is referred to as tropicalisation.</p><p>The metric space in which we work is the following.</p><p>Definition 3 (Tropical projective torus, Tropical metric). The n-dimensional tropical projective torus is a quotient space constructed by endowing R n+1 with the equivalence relation</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">x ‚àº y ‚áî x = a ‚äô y;<label>(1)</label></formula><p>it is denoted by R n+1 /R1. The generalised Hilbert projective metric, also referred to as the tropical metric, is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">d tr (x, y) = max i {x i -y i } -min i {x i -y i } = max i,j {x i -y i -x j + y j },</formula><p>and is induced by the tropical norm ‚à•x‚à• tr = max</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">i x i -min i x i .</formula><p>As we are mapping between tropical projective tori of different dimensions, when necessary we will distinguish between metrics on different spaces by denoting the R n /R1 metric by d n tr . Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the tropical ball on the tropical projective plane, where we have normalised the first coordinate to embed into R 2 . We use this embedding, given more generally by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">œÜ : R n+1 /R1 ‚Üí R n , (x 0 , . . . , x n ) ‚Üí (x 2 -x 0 , . . . , x n -x 0 ),</formula><p>for all visualisation figures in this paper. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phylogenetic Trees</head><p>The space of phylogenetic trees with N leaves, which are metric N -trees with non-negative lengths on all edges, have an important connection to tropical geometry. It was proved by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Speyer &amp; Sturmfels (2004)</ref> that the tropical Grassmannian-the projective variety obtained by tropicalising the Grassmannian-is homeomorphic to the space of phylogenetic trees, and therefore the tropical projective torus is the ambient space of phylogenetic trees. Phylogenetic trees are a fundamental data type in biology that model evolutionary processes in many settings, such as the evolution of species and disease, as well as the spread of pathogens. The tropical projective torus, therefore, is an important space in mathematical biology as the ambient space of phylogenetic trees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">Tropical Matrices</head><p>To respect the tropical structure of the tropical projective torus, we use tropical matrices to map probability distributions from one tropical projective torus to another. Here we outline the behaviour of tropical matrix maps and their connections to tropical convexity as first presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Develin &amp; Sturmfels (2004)</ref> and discussed in Chapter 5.2 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Maclagan &amp; Sturmfels (2015)</ref>. The foundational objects of convexity analysisline segments and convex hulls -are defined in the tropical setting as follows:</p><p>Definition 4 (Tropical line segment, Tropical convex hull).

This condition is assumed through the rest of the manuscript. From the definition above, we can observe that the image of a tropical matrix M in R m /R1 is the tropical span of the columns of M ; when M has all real entries, its image in R m /R1 is the tropical convex hull of its columns <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Maclagan &amp; Sturmfels, 2015)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Example 5.

They arise as a certain class of optimal transport problem, with applications in PDEs, image processing, optimisation and statistics. As opposed to f -divergences, they preserve the geometry of the state space over which they are defined and metrise weak convergence results such as the central limit theorem (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Lee et al., 2022, Section 3.1)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">(0, a -b, a -c) (0, d -e, d -f ) Type: ({1, 2}, ‚àÖ, ‚àÖ) M x = (a + x1, d + x1) Type: ({2}, ‚àÖ, {1}) M x = (c + x3, d + x1) Type: (‚àÖ, ‚àÖ, {1, 2}) M x = (c + x3, f + x3) Type: (‚àÖ, {1}, {2}) M x = (b + x2, f + x3) Type: (‚àÖ, {1, 2}, ‚àÖ) M x = (b + x2, e + x2) Type: ({2}, {1}, ‚àÖ) M x = (b + x2, d + x1)</formula><p>The Wasserstein distance is a solution to a particular case of the optimal transport problem, first introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Monge (1781)</ref>. The optimal transport problem is the search for an optimal mapping to transport a set of resources from their sources to sinks which minimises the transport cost. When the cost function is given by a distance between source and sink, the solution to the optimal transport problem yields the Wasserstein distances. The space on which the source and sink locations are located is referred to as the state space, while the physical distance that the resources need to be transported is measured by the ground metric.</p><p>The optimal transport problem was then relaxed to a probabilistic framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kantorovich, 1942)</ref>. The question is then to find the optimal coupling of two random variables which minimises the expectation of a cost function; when the cost function is the ground metric of the state space, the solution to the problem gives the Wasserstein distance between probability measures.

We consider j 0 such that i ‚àà S j0 , notice that this exists since S covers [m]. Since x ‚àà X S‚à™T the following equation holds:</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">M ij + x j = M ij0 + x j0 = y i , implying that x j = M ij0 -M ij + x j0</formula><p>.

Notice that we don't need to prove the case in which 1 ‚àà T k and i ‚àà S i , as the roles of S and T are equivalent and so the same proof applies swapping their roles.

We know that R n /R1 = ‚à™ S X S , which implies that F y = ‚à™ S (X S ‚à© F y ). So it is enough to prove that X S ‚à© F y = X S ‚à© B S y . We start by proving X S ‚à© F y ‚äÜ X S ‚à© B S y . Consider i ‚àà [n] and k, j ‚àà [m], such that 1 ‚àà S k and i ‚àà S j , and fix x ‚àà X S ‚à© F y . It follows from the definition of types that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">(M x) i -(M x) 1 = x j + M ij -x k -M 1k .</formula><p>(5)</p><p>We can therefore write x j -x k as</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">x j -x k = M 1k -M ij + (x j + M ij ) -(M 1k + x k ) = M 1k -M ij + (M x) i -(M x) 1 (6) = M 1k -M ij + y i -y 1 ,</formula><p>where the penultimate equality is given by ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) and the final equality follows from x ‚àà F y .

Therefore the fibre F y = ‚à™ S C S y is a polyhedral complex, as desired.</p><p>Remark 14. From our proof of Lemma 13, we note that the poset of fibre cells C S y is given by a reverse type inclusion as in the case of type cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Develin &amp; Sturmfels, 2004)</ref>. Therefore, the maximal cells C S y of the fibre are exactly those whose type is given by a partition of [m] (and copies of the empty set).</p><p>We see in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> that fibre polyhedral complexes can have mixed dimension. A push-forward M (ŒΩ) through such matrices can preserve little to none of the structure of ŒΩ due to this irregular fibre dimension. We would therefore like to restrict our considerations to matrices with fibres of consistent dimension n -m. In the next section we identify the set of such matrices as the set of simple projections.</p></div>

By Remark 14 a fibre cell C S y is maximal iff S is a partition which is equivalent to X S being a maximal cell. For such an S, we define the classical matrix M S ‚àà R m√ón and b S ‚àà R m as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">M S i,j := 1, if i ‚àà S j , 0, if i / ‚àà S j b i := M i,j(i) ,</formula><p>where j(i) is the only j such that i ‚àà S j .

The dimension the maximal fibre cell C S y in X S is then given by the dimension of the kernel of M S . Since this is a 0/1 matrix with one non-zero entry per row, we may use a standard linear algebra argument to derive that</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">KerM S = |{j ‚àà [m] : M S ‚Ä¢,j = 0}| = |{j ‚àà [m] : S j = ‚àÖ}| ‚â§ n -m.</formula><p>From this we can deduce that every maximal type cell has exactly m non-empty S j if and only if, ‚àÄ y ‚àà R m /R1, every maximal cell in F y has dimension n -m.

Do such maps necessarily minimise the Wasserstein distance? The advantages of studying these simple projections are two-fold; we may be able to speed up computations by computing an infimum over a subset of simple projections rather than over all simple projections, and a theoretical understanding such maps may allow us to interpret the optimal simple projection as interpretable relations between the two leaf sets.

These are special cases of phylogenetic trees which are equidistant; they are rooted phylogenetic trees where the distance from every leaf to its root is a constant. The set of such trees forms a tropical linear space, and hence is tropically convex <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Lin et al., 2017)</ref>. This convexity has been recently used to characterise the combinatorial behaviour of tree topologies in the tropical setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Lin et al., 2022)</ref>. The Open Problems 29 and 30 can also be posed with respect to ultrametric tree space rather than general tropical tree space, and may prove to be more tractable by utilising the tropical convexity of ultrametric space.</p></div>

For each dataset pair, we run Algorithm 1 from 10 random initialisations and take the minimal value over all initialisations. Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows the Wasserstein distances between these datasets as a matrix heatmap.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Computation for Influenza Data</head><p>To conclude the computational section of this paper, we use Algorithm 1 to compute Wasserstein distances between real phylogenetic datasets which are supported on different datasets.</p><p>We use the pre-processed phylogenetic influenza datasets presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Monod et al.

The raw genomic data was then aligned using MUSCLE <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Edgar, 2004)</ref> with default settings, to construct a single large phylogenetic tree for the influenza strains across all seasons. Finally, tree dimensionality reduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Zairis et al., 2016)</ref> is applied to represent this large phylogenetic tree as a dataset of smaller trees using temporal windows of 5 years; this produces 21 datasets of approximately 20,000 trees each, where the leaf set of a given dataset corresponds to 5 consecutive years.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>In this manuscript, we have studied the problem of comparing probability distributions over tropical projective tori with different dimensions and formulated an inter-dimensional Wasserstein distance for this purpose. Our construction was largely inspired by a recent solution to the same problem in Euclidean spaces. We highlighted the key components of semi-orthogonal maps used in the Euclidean setting and identified tropical matrices with the same properties to be able to arrive at the same conclusion on tropical projective tori. Specifically, we studied tropical simple projections; only the basic properties of non-expansivity, surjectivity, and fibres of consistent dimension were required in order to achieve the same result as in the Euclidean setting, even though the tropical projective torus can be seen as comparatively more restrictive (e.g., it is not a Hilbert space under the tropical norm <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Am√©ndola &amp; Monod, 2024)</ref>).</p><p>Considering our motivating application of phylogenetic statistics, it would be natural to build on this work by a consideration of how simple projections act on tree space; which simple projections map tree space to tree space? Does it suffice to consider such maps when finding the optimal map between tree datasets? Can a simple projection which maps tree space to tree space be described by operations on leaves? These questions, which we discussed in more detail in Subsection 4.2 present the opportunity to improve the speed of calculations through a restricted search of simple projections, as well as gaining more interpretability from Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>: The computed Wasserstein distance between branching, coalescent and Gaussian data of dimension 6, 10 and 15. We take a minimum over 10 initialisations of Algorithm 1, and use the tuned learning rate and scale from Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>. our calculations on the leaf level.</p><p>While our computational method in Algorithm 1 is a natural heuristic approach and easy to implement, further research into more sophisticated optimisation tools for calculating tropical projection Wasserstein distances would significantly improve the applicability of our distance. Currently, we lack confidence bounds on our computations in Section 5, and we can see immediately that our computations are not necessarily accurate; in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>, we see datasets whose distance to themselves is not zero. This may be a result of simulated annealing never reaching the optimal support as it is more common for datasets of higher dimension, but without confidence bounds our distances lack interpretability.</p><p>Finally, while tropical projection Wasserstein distances may be a useful tool for certain statistical methods such as clustering, utilising these distances for more refined model selection methods would require an understanding of their behaviour for standard tree models such as branching and coalescent processes. The computed values shown in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> do not suggest a clear pattern in the distances between datasets of the same distribution but different dimensionality, but there are many avenues for further numerical experiments. By computing distances between several samples from the same distribution, we may see some indication as to which distributions are well-clustered under the tropical projection Wasserstein distance and hence can be detected for model selection using this distance.</p><p>Academy of Doctoral Studies (JADS) award (2021 cohort, PIs Drton/Monod), from which R.T. also receives partial support.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix A Proof</head><p>Proof of Lemma 31. Consider a simple projection matrix M , and let M ‚Ä≤ be a tropical matrix map with exactly one real entry per column such that M ij ‚àà R ‚áí M ‚Ä≤ ij = 0. We begin by showing that on any ball B 0 (r) in R n /R1, there is some t ‚àà R n /R1 such that M (x) = M ‚Ä≤ (x + t).</p><p>For each j ‚àà ‚à™ i J i , let i j be the unique i such that j ‚àà J i . Then we can define a vector t ‚àà R n by</p><formula xml:id="formula_90">t j = -2r + min{M ij : M ij Ã∏ = -‚àû} if j / ‚àà ‚à™ i J i M ij j</formula><p>otherwise.</p><p>We now show that for x ‚àà B 0 (r), we have M x = M ‚Ä≤ (x + t). Let J ‚Ä≤ i be the support sets for M ‚Ä≤ . By definition, the sets J ‚Ä≤ i are disjoint, partition [n] exactly, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_91">J i ‚äÜ J ‚Ä≤ i . M ‚Ä≤ (x + t) = max j‚ààJ ‚Ä≤ i {M ‚Ä≤ ij + x j + t j } = max{max j‚ààJi {x j + M ij }, max j‚ààJ ‚Ä≤ i \Ji x j + -2r + min{M ij : M ij Ã∏ = -‚àû}} = max j‚ààJi {x j + M ij } = M (x)</formula><p>where the penultimate equality comes from ‚à•x‚à• tr ‚â§ r. Now, denoting the empirical measure of X as ŒΩ X , our set of projected measures becomes: where the constraints on t, M ‚Ä≤ and Œª are as described.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix B Gradient Methods</head><p>These experiments are aimed at the computation of the 2-Wasserstein projected distance W m,n tr,2 , and are restricted to samples X, Y of equal sizes R = S to reduce the computational complexity of optimal transport calculations.</p><p>We test the gradient methods CD, TD, CA, TA in the following way; for each dimension pair m ‚â§ n ‚àà {6, 10, 15}, we have 9 dataset pairs (X, Y ) where X, Y have been taken from a branching, coalescent or Gaussian distribution. We then run Algorithm 1 with 10 random initialisations for max iters = 40. Each iteration of Algorithm 1 involves 50 steps of the specified gradient method -we do not perform any Œª, M optimisation to minimise the random noise present. We do this for each dataset and gradient method for learning rates on a log scale between e -6 , e 4 . Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">6</ref> shows the mean loss achieved over 10 randomised initialisations and all 9 dataset pairs for each dimension pair and gradient settings.</p><p>We see that when n = m, classical and tropical methods behave similarly; their optimal mean loss is the same, though this minimum is achieved for different learning rates. However, when m &lt; n the tropical methods consistently achieve a smaller mean loss.  <ref type="bibr">.196 1.196 1.196 1.196 1.196 1.194 1.195</ref>  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The tropical ball under œÜ : R 3 /R1 ‚Üí R 2</figDesc></figure>
