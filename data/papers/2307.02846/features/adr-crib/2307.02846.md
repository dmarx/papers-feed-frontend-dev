The decisions made by the researchers in the study of comparing probability distributions using tropical geometry are grounded in a combination of mathematical rigor, practical applicability, and the unique properties of tropical geometry. Below is a detailed technical explanation and rationale for each of the decisions listed:

### 1. Decision to Use Tropical Geometry for Comparing Probability Distributions
Tropical geometry provides a framework that allows for the analysis of geometric structures in a way that is particularly suited for combinatorial and algebraic problems. The researchers chose tropical geometry because it can handle the complexities of comparing probability distributions in spaces of different dimensions, which is a common challenge in applications like phylogenetics. The tropical projective torus serves as a natural setting for these comparisons, as it captures the essential features of the underlying data structures.

### 2. Choice of Wasserstein Distance as the Primary Metric
The Wasserstein distance is favored because it metrizes weak convergence of measures and reflects the geometry of the underlying state space. This property is crucial when comparing distributions, especially in high-dimensional settings. The researchers aimed to extend the applicability of Wasserstein distances to tropical settings, where traditional metrics may fail to capture the necessary geometric relationships.

### 3. Selection of Tropical Projective Tori as the Focal Metric Spaces
Tropical projective tori are central in tropical geometry and serve as the ambient space for many applications, including phylogenetic trees. By focusing on these tori, the researchers leverage existing theoretical foundations and results, making it easier to establish connections between probability distributions and the geometric properties of the tori.

### 4. Assumption of Equivalence in Directional Mappings Between Different Dimensional Spaces
The researchers assumed that the directional mappings between different dimensional spaces are equivalent to simplify the analysis. This assumption allows for a more straightforward formulation of the Wasserstein distance, as it eliminates the need to distinguish between mappings from lower to higher dimensions and vice versa, thus streamlining the computational process.

### 5. Decision to Leverage Existing Euclidean Results for Tropical Settings
By building on existing results from Euclidean spaces, the researchers can utilize established mathematical tools and concepts, which enhances the robustness of their findings. This decision also facilitates the transfer of knowledge from a well-studied area (Euclidean geometry) to a less explored one (tropical geometry), thereby enriching the theoretical framework.

### 6. Choice of Max-Plus Convention Over Min-Plus Convention in Tropical Algebra
The max-plus convention was chosen because it aligns with recent applications in tropical geometry and is more commonly used in the literature. This choice ensures consistency with existing work, making it easier for readers familiar with the field to engage with the research.

### 7. Decision to Use Tropical Matrices for Mapping Probability Distributions
Tropical matrices are essential for representing linear transformations in tropical geometry. The researchers opted for tropical matrices because they preserve the tropical structure of the projective tori, allowing for effective mapping of probability distributions while maintaining the necessary algebraic properties.

### 8. Assumption of Non-Degeneracy Condition for Tropical Matrices
The non-degeneracy condition ensures that the tropical matrices map into the tropical projective torus correctly. This assumption is critical for the validity of the results, as it guarantees that the images of the matrices retain the necessary structure for further analysis.

### 9. Choice of Numerical Optimization Techniques for Computational Feasibility
The researchers selected numerical optimization techniques to ensure that their approach is computationally feasible. Given the complexity of the tropical settings and the potential high dimensionality of the data, efficient optimization methods are essential for practical implementation and real-world applications.

### 10. Decision to Focus on Applications in Phylogenetic Trees
Phylogenetic trees represent a rich area of application for comparing probability distributions, particularly in biological contexts. By focusing on this area, the researchers can demonstrate the practical relevance of their theoretical findings, making a compelling case for the utility of tropical geometry in real-world scenarios.

### 11. Assumption of the Relevance of Tropical Geometry in Statistical and Machine Learning Contexts
The researchers assumed that tropical geometry has significant relevance in statistical and machine learning contexts due to its ability to handle complex data structures and relationships. This assumption is supported by emerging applications in these fields, indicating a growing interest in tropical methods.

### 12. Decision to Structure the Manuscript with Specific Sections for Background, Methods, and Results
A clear manuscript structure enhances readability and comprehension. By organizing the work into distinct sections, the researchers facilitate a logical flow of information, allowing readers to follow the development of ideas from background concepts to methods and results.

### 13. Choice of Simulated and Real Data for Demonstrating the Proposed Distance
Using both simulated and real data allows the researchers to validate their theoretical findings in practical scenarios. Simulated data can help illustrate specific properties of the proposed distance, while real data demonstrates its applicability and effectiveness in real-world situations.

### 14. Decision to Define Tropical Convexity and Its Implications for the Study
Defining tropical convexity is crucial for understanding the behavior of tropical matrices and the structure
