The research presented in the document addresses the complex problem of comparing probability distributions across different dimensional spaces, particularly within the framework of tropical geometry. Below is a detailed technical explanation of the researchers' decisions regarding the various components of their study.

### Problem Statement
The researchers emphasize the importance of comparing probability distributions in different dimensional spaces, particularly in the context of phylogenetic trees. This is crucial because phylogenetic trees often have varying numbers of leaves, which correspond to different dimensions in the underlying mathematical representation. By focusing on this problem, the researchers aim to provide a robust framework that can handle the intricacies of biological data, which is often high-dimensional and complex.

### Wasserstein Distance
The choice of Wasserstein distance as a metric for comparing probability distributions is justified by its properties. Wasserstein distance is defined through optimal transport, which allows for a meaningful comparison of distributions even when they are supported in different spaces. It metrizes weak convergence, making it particularly useful in statistical applications where convergence of distributions is a concern. The researchers leverage this property to extend the concept of Wasserstein distance to tropical geometry, thereby providing a new tool for analyzing distributions in this context.

### Tropical Projective Torus
The definition of the n-dimensional tropical projective torus as \( R^{n+1}/R^1 \) is a strategic choice that aligns with the geometric nature of tropical geometry. The tropical metric defined by \( d_{tr}(x, y) = \max_i (x_i - y_i) - \min_i (x_i - y_i) \) captures the essence of distances in tropical spaces, allowing for a clear and effective comparison of points. This metric is particularly suited for the tropical setting, where traditional Euclidean metrics may not apply.

### Tropical Algebra
The researchers adopt tropical algebra, defined as the semiring \( R = R \cup \{-\infty\} \), with operations of tropical addition and multiplication. This choice is motivated by the need to work within a framework that accommodates the unique properties of tropical geometry. Tropical addition (max operation) and multiplication (standard addition) allow for the formulation of algebraic structures that are essential for defining tropical polynomials and other mathematical objects relevant to their study.

### Mapping Between Tori
The equivalence of directionality in mappings between low and high-dimensional tori is a significant finding. This flexibility allows researchers to choose the most convenient mapping direction when comparing distributions, which can simplify calculations and enhance the applicability of their methods. This decision reflects a deep understanding of the geometric properties of tropical spaces and their implications for probability measures.

### Tropical Convexity
The definitions of tropical line segments and tropical convex hulls are crucial for establishing the framework of tropical convexity. By defining these concepts, the researchers can analyze the structure of probability distributions in tropical spaces, which is essential for understanding how these distributions can be compared and manipulated. The use of tropical convexity aligns with the broader goals of the research, which seeks to extend classical concepts of convexity into the tropical realm.

### Type of a Point
The definition of the type of a point in relation to a tropical matrix is a key aspect of the researchers' approach. By characterizing the local behavior of tropical matrices through the type of a point, they can gain insights into the structure of the mappings and the distributions being compared. This combinatorial perspective is essential for understanding the global behavior of the mappings and the resulting Wasserstein distances.

### Applications
The practical implications of the research are highlighted through its applications in comparing probability distributions on phylogenetic trees with different leaf sets. This is particularly relevant in biomedical and evolutionary studies, where understanding the relationships between different species or strains of pathogens is critical. By providing a framework that can handle these complexities, the researchers contribute valuable tools for practitioners in these fields.

### Computational Feasibility
The researchers demonstrate the computational feasibility of their proposed methods through numerical experiments on both simulated and real data. This decision is crucial for establishing the practicality of their approach, as it shows that the theoretical constructs can be effectively implemented in real-world scenarios. By validating their methods through empirical testing, they enhance the credibility and applicability of their findings.

### Future Work
The discussion on extending the framework and exploring potential applications in other areas of statistics and machine learning reflects a forward-thinking approach. By acknowledging the limitations of their current work and suggesting avenues for future research, the researchers position their study as a foundational step in a broader exploration of tropical geometry and its applications.

In summary, the researchers' decisions throughout the study are grounded in a deep understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of comparing probability distributions in tropical geometry. Their work not only addresses a significant gap in the literature but also provides a robust framework for future research and applications in various fields.
