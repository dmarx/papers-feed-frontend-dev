- **Problem Statement**: Comparing probability distributions in different dimensional spaces, particularly in tropical geometry, is essential for applications like phylogenetic trees.

- **Wasserstein Distance**: A metric that measures the distance between probability distributions, defined via optimal transport. It metrizes weak convergence and reflects the geometry of the underlying state space.

- **Tropical Projective Torus**: The n-dimensional tropical projective torus is defined as \( R^{n+1}/R^1 \) with the tropical metric given by:
  \[
  d_{tr}(x, y) = \max_i (x_i - y_i) - \min_i (x_i - y_i)
  \]

- **Tropical Algebra**: Defined as the semiring \( R = R \cup \{-\infty\} \) with operations:
  - Tropical addition: \( a \oplus b = \max(a, b) \)
  - Tropical multiplication: \( a \odot b = a + b \)

- **Mapping Between Tori**: The study shows that the directionality of mappings between low and high dimensional tori is equivalent, allowing flexibility in comparing distributions.

- **Tropical Convexity**: Key definitions include:
  - Tropical line segment: 
  \[
  \gamma_{ab} = \{ \alpha \odot a \oplus \beta \odot b \mid \alpha, \beta \in R \}
  \]
  - Tropical convex hull:
  \[
  tconv(X) = \{ \alpha_1 \odot x_1 \oplus \alpha_2 \odot x_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus \alpha_r \odot x_r \mid \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_r \in R \}
  \]

- **Type of a Point**: For a tropical matrix \( M \in R^{m \times n} \), the type of a point \( x \) is defined as:
  \[
  S_j = \{ i \in [m] \mid (M x)_i = M_{i\cdot} \odot x \text{ attains its maximum at } M_{ij} + x_j \}
  \]

- **Applications**: The framework allows for the comparison of probability distributions on phylogenetic trees with different leaf sets, crucial for biomedical and evolutionary studies.

- **Computational Feasibility**: The proposed methods are computationally feasible, demonstrated through numerical experiments on simulated and real data.

- **Future Work**: Discussion on extending the framework and potential applications in other areas of statistics and machine learning.
