  "abstract": "Networks of weakly coupled oscillators had a profound impact on our\nunderstanding of complex systems. Studies on model reconstruction from data\nhave shown prevalent contributions from hypernetworks with triplet and higher\ninteractions among oscillators, in spite that such models were originally\ndefined as oscillator networks with pairwise interactions. Here, we show that\nhypernetworks can spontaneously emerge even in the presence of pairwise albeit\nnonlinear coupling given certain triplet frequency resonance conditions. The\nresults are demonstrated in experiments with electrochemical oscillators and in\nsimulations with integrate-and-fire neurons. By developing a comprehensive\ntheory, we uncover the mechanism for emergent hypernetworks by identifying\nappearing and forbidden frequency resonant conditions. Furthermore, it is shown\nthat microscopic linear (difference) coupling among units results in coupled\nmean fields, which have sufficient nonlinearity to facilitate hypernetworks.\nOur findings shed light on the apparent abundance of hypernetworks and provide\na constructive way to predict and engineer their emergence.",
