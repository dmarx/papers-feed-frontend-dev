- **Emergence of Hypernetworks**: Hypernetworks can spontaneously emerge in weakly coupled oscillator systems, even with pairwise nonlinear coupling, under specific triplet frequency resonance conditions.

- **Key Experimental Setup**: The study utilized a ring network of four electrochemical oscillators with nonlinear feedback, demonstrating periodic current and potential oscillations at a natural frequency of 0.385 Hz.

- **Natural Frequency Ratios**: The natural frequencies of oscillators were set with ratios: \( \frac{\omega_2}{\omega_1} \approx 2.5 \), \( \frac{\omega_3}{\omega_1} \approx 1.5 \), and \( \frac{\omega_4}{\omega_1} \approx 2.5 \), facilitating triplet resonances.

- **Phase Dynamics**: The slow triplet phase differences are defined as:
  \[
  \phi_1 = \theta_1 - \theta_2 + \theta_3, \quad \phi_2 = \theta_1 - \theta_4 + \theta_3
  \]

- **Triplet Interaction Strength**: The strength of triplet interactions is quantified by:
  \[
  H_{k,j} = (C_{k,j})^2 + (D_{k,j})^2
  \]
  where \( C_{k,j} \) and \( D_{k,j} \) are the amplitudes of the sine and cosine phase coupling functions.

- **Nonlinear Coupling Dynamics**: The dynamics of the oscillators are described by:
  \[
  \dot{z}_k = f_k(z_k) + \alpha \sum_{n=1} A_k h_k(z_k, z)
  \]
  where \( f_k(z_k) = \gamma_k z_k + \beta_k z_k |z_k|^2 \).

- **Hopf Bifurcation**: The emergence of oscillations in nonlinear systems is often associated with a Hopf bifurcation, characterized by resonance conditions for \( \gamma_k = \lambda + i\omega_k \).

- **Non-resonance Condition**: The non-resonance condition for higher-order interactions is given by:
  \[
  (d_1 - d_2 - 1)\omega_k + (d_3 - d_4)\omega = 0
  \]

- **Higher-order Interaction Prediction**: The theory predicts higher-order interactions through a polynomial change of variables, leading to new coupling functions that explain anomalous synchronization transitions.

- **Coupling Function Example**: An example coupling function used in the analysis is:
  \[
  h(z, w) = zw + z^2w
  \]

- **Interaction Terms**: The resulting equations contain multiple interaction terms, with specific terms being resonant or forbidden based on the network topology.

- **Algorithm for Hypernetwork Detection**: An algorithm is provided to reveal emergent hypernetworks and their coupling functions across various disciplines, enhancing the understanding of complex systems.

- **Critical Transitions Characterization**: The emergent hypernetworks facilitate dimension reduction, allowing for the characterization of critical transitions in oscillator dynamics.
