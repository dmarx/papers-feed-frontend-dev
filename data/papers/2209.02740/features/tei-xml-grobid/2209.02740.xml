<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Networks of weakly coupled oscillators had a profound impact on our understanding of complex systems. Studies on model reconstruction from data have shown prevalent contributions from hypernetworks with triplet and higher interactions among oscillators, in spite that such models were originally defined as oscillator networks with pairwise interactions. Here, we show that hypernetworks can spontaneously emerge even in the presence of pairwise albeit nonlinear coupling given certain triplet frequency resonance conditions. The results are demonstrated in experiments with electrochemical oscillators and in simulations with integrate-and-fire neurons. By developing a comprehensive theory, we uncover the mechanism for emergent hypernetworks by identifying appearing and forbidden frequency resonant conditions. Furthermore, it is shown that microscopic linear (difference) coupling among units results in coupled mean fields, which have sufficient nonlinearity to facilitate hypernetworks. Our findings shed light on the apparent abundance of hypernetworks and provide a constructive way to predict and engineer their emergence.</p></div>

In these models, the interactions are described in a pairwise manner and the collective dynamics of a network can be predicted by the superposition of such pairwise interactions.</p><p>Recent work, however, suggests that many networks described as pairwise interactions can be better described in terms of hypernetworks with triplet and quadruplet interactions among nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.

We uncover a mechanism that generates higherorder interactions as a model to describe oscillator networks from data. First, we show that sparse model recovery from data reveals higher-order interactions. We then develop a theory for the emergence of such higher-order interactions when the isolated system is close to a Hopf bifurcation. We provide an algorithm to reveal emergent hypernetwork and its emergent coupling functions for any network in disciplines ranging from neuroscience to chemistry. The emergent hypernetworks provide a dimension reduction that allows the characterization of critical transitions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Emergent hypernetworks in electrochemical experiments</head><p>We designed an experimental system with four oscillatory chemical reactions coupled with nonlinear feedback and delay arranged in a ring network (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> (a)). The set-up consists of a multichannel potentiostat interfaced with a real-time controller and connected to a Pt counter, a Hg/Hg 2 SO 4 sat K 2 SO 4 reference, and four Ni working electrodes in 3.0 M sulfuric acid electrolyte. At a constant circuit potential (V 0 =1100 mV with respect to the reference electrode) and with an external resistance (R ind =1.0 kohm) attached to each nickel wire, the electrochemical dissolution of nickel exhibits periodic current and electrode potential oscillations with a natural frequency of 0.385 Hz.</p><p>Without coupling, we adjusted the natural frequency of each oscillator to have a ratio with respect to oscillator 1 as ω 2 /ω 1 = 2.53 (≈ 2.5), ω 3 /ω 1 =1.56 (≈ 1.5) and ω 4 /ω 1 = 2.53 (≈ 2.5) with a set of resistors and capacitors (C ind ), see Supplementary Note 1.) The natural frequencies create opportunities for triplet resonances, as there are small detunings for ω 1 -ω 2 + ω 3 and ω 1 -ω 4 + ω 3 , as well as pairwise resonances ω 2 ≈ ω 4 .</p><p>The individual electrode potentials (E k ) were recorded and rescaled and offset corrected</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Ẽk = O k [E k -o k ],<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where o k and O k are the time-averaged electrode potential and amplitude rescaling factor, respectively. (The rescaling factors, O k = 0.5, 1, 0.5, 1 V were applied to counter the different amplitudes of the slow oscillators.) A ring-coupling can be introduced with external feedback (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">1 (b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>)) according to</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">V k (t) = V 0,k + K 4 =1 A k h[ Ẽk (t), Ẽ (t -τ )],<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where V k (t) and V 0,k are the applied and the offset circuit potential of the kth electrode, respectively, K is the coupling strength, A k is the adjacency matrix, τ is a time delay, and h[ Ẽk (t), Ẽ (t -τ )] = ( Ẽk (t) + Ẽk (t) 2 ) Ẽ (t -τ ).</p><p>This delayed nonlinear feedback modulates the impact of the coupled units with a bias towards positive values (similar to a diode operation in the (-1, 1) interval). Note that this form of feedback is fundamentally different from previously applied nonlinear schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> in that it does not produce obvious synchronization patterns, for example, one and multi-cluster states. From the potentials Ẽk we extract the frequencies θk and apply a first-order Savitzky-Golay filter with a time window of 45 s to remove the in-cycle and short-range phase fluctuation, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> (e) (solid line). For each oscillator, a slow variation is seen as the oscillators slow down and speed up on a timescale of about 100 s (or 40 cycles); notably, the elements 1 and 3 exhibit similar θk oscillations, which are different from those in elements 2 and 4.</p><p>To describe the nature of the phase dynamics, we consider the slow triplet phase differences</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">φ 1 = θ 1 -θ 2 + θ 3 φ 2 = θ 1 -θ 4 + θ 3 ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>which correspond to the triplet frequency detunings.</p><p>The impact of triplet interactions on the dynamics can be extracted with a LASSO fit to θk = ωk (t) +</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">2 j=1 C k j sin(φ j ) + D k j cos(φ j )<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where ωk (t) = ω0 k + ω1 k t + ω2 k t 2 is the fitted, slowly drifting (up to quadratic variation in time) natural frequency, and C k j and D k j are the amplitudes of the sin and cos phase coupling functions corresponding to the appropriate triplet phase differences. The strength of the triplet interactions j = 1, 2 (for φ j ) on oscillator k is given by the amplitudes</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">H k j = (C k j ) 2 + (D k j ) 2 .</formula><p>The dynamics of oscillators 1 and 3 are impacted by both triplet interactions; φ 1 impacts oscillators 1 and 3 with amplitudes 4.9 × 10 -3 and 4.4 × 10 -3 , and φ 2 with 2.3 × 10 -3 and 3.2 × 10 -3 , respectively. However, the dynamics of oscillators 2 and 4 are only impacted by triplet interactions φ 1 (with amplitude 1.33 × 10 -2 ) and φ 2 (1.7 × 10 -2 ), respectively. These triplet interactions describe phase fluctuations over the long time scale (red curves in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">1 (e)</ref>). Therefore, we can conclude that the phase dynamics of the oscillators coupled in a ring can be described by a hypernetwork shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">1 (f)</ref>.</p><p>The fact that model recovery provides triplets as the best description is rather puzzling. Also given that the resonant behavior ω 2 ≈ ω 4 did not appear in the model recovery from data. This suggests an interplay between the resonant frequencies and the network topology. The question arises, which resonances/triplet interactions emerge from a large number of possibilities in a given network, natural frequencies, and nonlinear coupling? An outstanding question is what is the origin of these triplet interactions that were generated by pairwise physical coupling?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A theory for emergent higher-order interactions</head><p>To answer these questions, we develop a theory that captures the important characteristics of the experiments: nonlinear coupling and triplet resonance conditions. We consider the networks</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">żk = f k (z k ) + α n =1 A k h k (z k , z )<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where z k ∈ C is the state of the kth oscillator, h k : C × C → C is the pairwise coupling function, A k is the adjacency matrix, and α &gt; 0 is the coupling strength. When the isolated system is close to a Hopf bifurcation, the dynamics is described by</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">f k (z k ) = γ k z k + β k z k |z k | 2 [28]</formula><p>. The Hopf bifurcation is a common route to oscillations in nonlinear systems and describes the appearance of oscillations in applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. Our proofs are valid for γ k = λ + iω k with small λ and ω k satisfying resonance conditions. We fix β k = -1, but this value is immaterial. We develop a normal form theory to eliminate unnecessary terms of h(z k , z ) and to expose higher-order ones that predict the dynamics. To a network of the form of Eq. (S140)</p><p>we associate non-resonance conditions that allow us to get rid of the leading interaction terms in α.</p><p>Since h(z k , z ) is a linear combination of monomials and the theory can be applied to each monomial independently, we assume first that h(z k , z ) is a single monomial of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">h(z k , z ) = z d 1 k zd 2 k z d 3 zd 4<label>(7)</label></formula><p>for non-negative numbers d 1 , . . . , d 4 . Our major theoretical result is a formulation of a nonresonance condition given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">(d 1 -d 2 -1)ω k + (d 3 -d 4 )ω = 0.<label>(8)</label></formula><p>This condition shows up naturally in our approach, as a monomial Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">7</ref>) can only be eliminated by a transformation that divides by the left-hand side of Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">8</ref>). Hence, an interaction term in the coupling function h given by Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">7</ref>) can only be removed if the non-resonance condition is satisfied. The non-resonance condition is defined as the union over all non-resonance conditions of its monomial terms. The network non-resonance conditions are given by the union over all non-resonance conditions of h(z k , z ) for which A k = 0. Our result is the following:</p><p>In Methods, we show that given Eq. (S140) with h : C × C → C a smooth map with vanishing constant terms, under the network non-resonance conditions, there is a coordinate transformation that eliminates pairwise interaction terms and reveals the higher-order interactions. The proof consists of two main steps: i) Existence of a polynomial change of variables. Consider</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">u k = z k -αP k<label>(9)</label></formula><p>for some polynomials P k . The goal is to design P k such that in the variables u k interaction terms linear in α vanish. We obtain higher-order interactions of order α 2 . For Eq. (S140) we use</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">P k (z) = n =1 A k hk (z k , z ) ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where hk (z, w) is the function obtained from h(z, w) by transforming each monomial according to the following replacement rule:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">z d 1 zd 2 w d 3 wd 4 → z d 1 zd 2 w d 3 wd 4 (d 1 -1)γ k + d 2 γk + d 3 γ + d 4 γ<label>(11)</label></formula><p>Note that the imaginary part of the denominator in Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">11</ref>) is precisely the left-hand side of Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. While bringing the equations to the new form, we face a major challenge to understand the combinatorial behavior of the Taylor coefficients during the transformation.</p><p>We define a bracket on the space of polynomials to track these coefficients.</p><p>ii) Dealing with transformed isolated dynamics. The second major challenge lies in the fact that another coordinate transformation is needed to eliminate terms coming from the isolated dynamics f k . Indeed, as we eliminate coupling terms linear in α, other terms linear in α appear due to the isolated dynamics. A remarkable fact is that the same non-resonance conditions also ensure that the second transformation exists.</p><p>Our theorem is applicable to a much broader class of coupling functions and network formalisms than what is described by Eq. (S140). A rich variety of new interaction rules can emerge, depending on the specifics of the set-up (see Supplementary Note 2).</p><p>Applying the replacement rule Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">11</ref>) we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">uk = f k (u k ) -α 2 n =1 n p=1 A k A kp 1 G p k (u k , u , u p ) -A k A p 2 G p k (u k , u , u p ) ,<label>(12)</label></formula><p>up to higher-order terms in α and u. In Methods, we discuss the new coupling functions 1 G k and 2 G k some their properties. The coupling is now α 2 explaining anomalous synchronization transitions that appears in networks (see Supplementary Note 3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Emergent hypernetworks explain experimental data</head><p>Similar to the experiments we consider a ring of four oscillators with coupling function</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">h(z, w) = z w + z 2 w. (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_15">)</formula><p>Instead of delay, the oscillators are coupled through a conjugate variable that enables a streamlined theoretical treatment. Close to a Hopf bifurcation, the delay would have an effect of advancing the oscillations over half a period. As before, we consider ω 1 -ω 2 +ω 3 and ω 1 -ω 4 +ω 3 to be close to zero, so, capturing the triplet resonance in the experiments. We apply our theory to this case to unravel how higher-order interactions appear in the data.</p><p>The coupling function is a combination of z w and z 2 w, providing d 1 = 1 and d 4 = 1 for the first monomial and d 1 = 2 and d 4 = 1 for the latter. The resonance condition Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">8</ref>) is satisfied for both. Using the replacement rule Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">11</ref>), we find</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">u k = z k + α z k-1 z k γk-1 + z k z k+1 γk+1 + z 2 k-1 zk γ k-1 + γk + z 2 k zk+1 γ k + γk+1<label>(14)</label></formula><p>Each node equation contains 16 interaction terms as in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">12</ref>). We discuss some of these terms for the first node. 2 G 23 1 appears as node 1 is connected to node 2 and 2 to 3. This interaction is resonant, see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> (a). 2 G 43 1 appears because node 1 is connected to 4 and node 4 to 3. This term is also resonant, see Figure <ref type="figure">2 (b</ref>). 1 G 24  1 is nonzero and nonresonant. This term appear as 1 is directed connected to 2 and 4, see Figure <ref type="figure">2 (c</ref>). Finally, the term 2 G 24  1 is a forbidden, the term would appear from an interaction of 1 to 2 and from 2 to 4, however, in the original network the later interaction is absent, see Figure <ref type="figure">2 (d)</ref>. Remarkably, not all interactions are relevant when the goal is to describe slow oscillations in the phases.</p><p>Indeed, once we analyse the phases in the new equations, the coupling term coming from 2 G 23  1 will lead to oscillations with frequency close to ω 1 -ω 2 + ω 3 while the term coming from 2 G 43 1 leads to a frequency close to ω 1 -ω 4 + ω 3 . This implies that both terms are slowly varying. In contrast, the term coming from 2 G 24  1 leads to oscillations with frequency ω 1 -ω 2 + ω 4 ≈ ω 1 and is fast oscillating in comparison to the slow terms with small frequencies. In virtue of the averaging theory, such fast oscillating terms can be neglected. In fact, only resonant terms connected by local trees in the original graph will survive such as the resonant ones involving  <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">12</ref>) of node 1. Colors correspond to signs in the phase combination with blue standing for positive and orange for negative. (a) resonant interaction term appearing as 2 G 23  1 .

These new interaction terms can be predicted from the combinatorics of the original network and coupling function.</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">ω 1 -ω 2 + ω 3 and ω 1 -ω 4 + ω 3 .

Rather, we prove that imposing sparsity unavoidably leads to the recovery of the normal form instead. Indeed, as the recovery allows for a small least square deviation between the data and the model, the recovery finds the hypernetwork as a simpler description of the system. So, by measuring the original variables and attempting a model recovery while imposing sparsity, model recovery learns only the higher-order interactions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We have uncovered a mechanism by which nonlinear pairwise interactions with triplet resonance conditions result in nontrivial phase dynamics on a hypernetwork. Such interactions traditionally were attributed in brain dynamics to synaptic transmission between two neurons The original network of coupled subpopulations (with four distinct colours, namely, red, yellow, blue and orange). Oscillators are interacting by an internal coupling constant µ and intersubpopulations coupling constant α. b) Higher order phase interaction of the mean-fields represented with the same colors as in a) (red, yellow, blue and orange). Applying our approach we uncover that the phase interaction between the mean-fields is described by a hypernetwork. c) The mean-field slow phase variables ϕ 1 (green) and ϕ 2 (purple) were computed from the data collected from the simulations of mean fields on the associated network. The dashed curve is the simulation of the vector field of the slow phases ϕ 1,2 reconstructed from data using the Lasso method.</p><p>mediated by chemical messengers from a third neuron (heterosynaptic plasticity) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Our findings provide an alternative mechanism. On one hand, this finding shows that phase dynamics can be mediated through 'virtual' interactions not physically present in the system. On the other hand, such a mechanism could be leveraged to design interactions between remote components not directly connected but instead having correlations in natural frequencies.</p><p>The experimental system with a generic network motif with a ring of four electrochemical oscillators presented here was an example, where a relatively simple nonlinear modulation of the coupling induced a hypernetwork driven phase dynamics. Networks with a ring topology are selected for the experiment since they are common for many network based complex systems, e.g., in lasers, biological systems, neuronal dynamics and many disciplines <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. Such nonlinear modulation of the coupling can be quite general in gene expressions; for example, it was used to describe the coupling among circadian cells through Michaelis-Menten mechanism where coupling from one cell modulated the maximum gene expression rate in the other <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</p><p>Strikingly, we showed that the coupling resulting in mean-field coupling among network modules has sufficient nonlinearity to facilitate hypernetwork interactions. In particular, event related modulation of spectral responses of magnetoencephalogram (MEG) recordings (i.e., modulation of frequency-specific oscillations in the motor network established by a handgrip task) have shown very strong evidence for nonlinear, between-frequency coupling of remote brain regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Our results strongly suggest that in these MEG recordings, given the appropriate resonances and nonlinearities, hypernetwork description could facilitate the long-range modulation of frequencies. In conclusion, the findings open new avenues for hypernetwork based description and engineering of complex systems with heterogeneous frequencies and nonlinear interactions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Preliminaries and results</head><p>In order to analyse the ODE (S29), it will be useful to write</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">H k (z) = H d k (z) + O(|z| d+1 ) ,</formula><p>where H d k (z) is a polynomial denoting the terms up to degree d in the Taylor expansion of H k (z) around the origin. We will mostly work with the value d = 5. Note that H d k (z) is therefore a polynomial in both the variables z 1 , . . . , z n and their complex conjugates z 1 , . . . , z n , with complex coefficients. In general, whenever we talk about a polynomial we will always mean a complex polynomial in its given complex variables and their complex conjugates. It will also be useful to write H(z) = (H k (z)) for the vector valued function that captures all interaction functions H k (z) as its components, and similarly set</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">H d (z) = (H d k (z)).</formula><p>As is often the case with normal form calculations, we will need to assume some conditions on the ω k (or more precisely the γ k ). These will depend on the coefficients of H 5 k (z). To this end, we define:</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">Definition 2.1. Let R(z) = cz s 1 1 . . . z sn n z t 1 1 . . . z tn n (S31)</formula><p>be a monomial term in H d k (z), where c is a complex number and s 1 , . . . , s n , t 1 , . . . , t n are nonnegative integers.

In fact, varying λ and allowing the particular case λ = 0, we see that equations (S32) and (S33) are equivalent in general. Next, the kth non-resonance condition of a polynomial is defined as the union of the kth non-resonance conditions of all of its monomial terms. Finally, the non-resonance condition</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">of a polynomial map H d (z) = (H d k (z))</formula><p>is the union over all k ∈ {1, . . . , n} of the kth nonresonance conditions of H d k (z).</p><p>Example 2.2.

(S35)</formula><p>Hence, we see that the non-resonance condition of H(z) = (H k (z)) is satisfied if we simply have ω = 0 for all nodes ∈ {1, . . . , n}.</p><p>Example 2.3.

It tells us that, under the relevant nonresonance conditions, we may transform the ODE (S29) into a system with leading interaction terms involving only three-way "hyper-interactions" and with coupling constant α 2 . See Proposition 2.9 for an exact description of the new leading interaction terms in Theorem 2.4.</p><p>Theorem 2.4. Let H 5 k denote the fifth order Taylor expansion of the kth interaction function H k : C n → C. Assume the non-resonance conditions for H 5 = (H 5 k ) to hold.

See Proposition 2.9 for an exact description of the G k .</p><p>Note that Equation (S39) gives a precise description of uk up to sixth order in u and α.</p><p>Remark 2.5. Theorem 2.4 tells us that, under the relevant non-resonance conditions, the α-terms can be 'pushed back' to order |α||u| 6 . Technically speaking, this means we can ignore these remainder terms only when αu 6 &lt;&lt; α 2 u 4 , i.e. when u 2 &lt;&lt; α. However, it will be clear from the proof in subsections 2.2 and 2.4 that if the non-resonance conditions hold for terms in H k beyond H 5 k , then we may arrange for a remainder in α with higher order terms in u. That is, we then get the remainder O(|α||u| N + |α| 2 |u| 5 + |α| 3 |u| 4 ) for a corresponding value of N &gt; 6. As the interaction functions H k are taken to be polynomials in our examples, with the non-resonance conditions holding for all terms, we in fact expect a remainder of the form O(|α||u| N + |α| 2 |u| 5 + |α| 3 |u| 4 ) for arbitrarily high value of N . Hence, we may neglect all terms that are first order in α, and obtain a new coupled system with coupling constant α 2 .</p><p>The new interaction functions G k can be obtained from H by a combinatorial construction on the Taylor coefficients. This is best described using a bracket on polynomials that we define below. We will furthermore make extensive use of this bracket throughout the proof of Theorem 2.4. Definition 2.6.

One important observation is given by: Lemma 2.12. The map (R, S) → [R||S] is complex linear in R and real linear in S.

Complex linearity in R is clear from the definition:</p><formula xml:id="formula_74">[R||S](z) := d dt R(z) żj = S j (w) ∀ j ∈ {1, . . . , n} . (S53)</formula><p>Because of this, it suffices to show real linearity in S when R is given by a monomial of the form R(z) = z i 1 z i 2 . . . z im z j 1 z j 2 . . . z j l , for some (not necessarily distinct) i 1 , . . . , i m , j 1 , . . . , j l ∈ {1, . . . , n}. We get</p><formula xml:id="formula_75">[R||S](z) = m s=1 R(z) z is S is (z) + l r=1 R(z) z ir S ir (z) ,<label>(S54)</label></formula><p>from which real linearity in S follows readily.</p><p>We will also make extensive use of the following definition:</p><p>Definition 2.13. Given a complex monomial</p><formula xml:id="formula_76">Q(z) = cz s 1 1 . . . z sn n z t 1 1 . . . z tn n ,</formula><p>where c ∈ C and with s 1 , . . . , s n , t 1 , . . . , t n non-negative integers, we define the degree of Q(z)</p><formula xml:id="formula_77">as the number s 1 + • • • + s n + t 1 + • • • + t n .</formula><p>The degree of a polynomial P (z) is then defined as the maximum of the degrees of all the monomial terms of P (z), as is common. Similarly, we define the lower degree of a polynomial P (z) as the minimum of the degrees of all of its monomial terms.</p><p>It turns out our bracket has a predictable effect on degrees:</p><p>Lemma 2.14. Let R be a polynomial and S = (S 1 , . . . , S n ) a vector of polynomials. If R has degree p &gt; 0 and each of the polynomial components of S has degree at most p , then [R||S] has degree p + p -1 or lower. If R has lower degree q &gt; 0 and each of the polynomial components of S has lower degree at least q , then [R||S] has lower degree q + q -1 or higher.</p><p>Proof. By linearity of the bracket (see Lemma 2.12), it suffices to show that the degree of</p><formula xml:id="formula_78">[R||S] is d + d -1 if</formula><p>R is a monomial of degree d and the components of S are all monomials of degree d . (By convention, we treat the zero-polynomial as a polynomial of any degree.) As in the proof of Lemma 2.12, we write</p><formula xml:id="formula_79">R(z) = z i 1 z i 2 . . . z im z j 1 z j 2 . . . z j l ,</formula><p>for some (not necessarily distinct) i 1 , . . . , i m , j 1 , . . . , j l ∈ {1, . . . , n}. It follows that m + l = d.</p><p>As in the previous proof we find</p><formula xml:id="formula_80">[R||S](z) = m s=1 R(z) z is S is (z) + l r=1 R(z) z ir S ir (z) ,<label>(</label></formula><p>S55) from which it follows readily that the degree of [R||S] is indeed d + d -1. This completes the proof. Remark 2.15. Lemmas 2.12 and 2.14 give us an easy way of finding the third and fourth order terms of G k = [ H k ||H] (and higher terms if necessary). It follows that the third order terms of G k are given by [ H 2 k ||H 2 ], where we use that H (and therefore each H 2 k</p><p>) has no constant and linear terms. Likewise, the fourth order terms of G k are given by the bracket between the second order terms of H k and the third order terms of H, plus the bracket between the third order terms of H k and the second order terms of H. Note also that G k need only be defined up to third and fourth order in Theorem 2.4, as higher order terms of α 2 G k (u) can be absorbed in the remainder O(|α| 2 |u| 5 ) of Equation (S39). For this reason the terms of degree 4 and higher in H k and H play no role in the construction of (the relevant terms of)</p><formula xml:id="formula_81">G k = [ H k ||H].</formula><p>Next, we consider G k in the situation where H k describes a coupled cell system as in the examples of the main text.</p><p>Remark 2.16.

In this regard, the emergent interaction function (S62) looks a lot like our original response function (S56), but counting such trees instead of links. The only way in which Equation (S62) does not generalize Equation (S56) perfectly is by the fact that 1 G p k and 1 G p k have indices k, and p (whereas h does not). However, we see from equations (S60) and (S61) that there is no dependence on p; this index is only there for notational purposes. Moreover, the dependence on k and is only through a rescaling of the monomials. Hence, we find an emergent interaction that is in very good agreement with a generalization of our original interaction to tree interaction. What is more, the trees that Equation (S62) counts are easily identified in the original graph.

Thus, also in this case when performing a model recovery with finite amount of data the function U cannot be recovered. This also happens for our examples in the main text.

We used an autocatalytic integrate-and-fire model <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> to simulate the behavior of four oscillators in a ring configuration with state variable v k , and a parameter for each oscillator p k that determines whether the variable is increasing or decreasing. In the model, we introduce nonlinear time-delayed coupling, and the oscillators are governed by the equations</p><p>where F k is a rescaling factor that affects the natural frequency of kth oscillator, K is the coupling strength, ṽk is the signal corrected for offset (ṽ k = v k -0.626), A k,l is the adjacency matrix, and τ is the time delay. When the variable v k reaches 1 from below, then p k is smoothly set to 0, and v k decreases.</p><p>Similarly, when the variable v k reaches from above A, p k is set to 1, and the variable starts to increase. We selected the threshold parameter A = 0.36 and the timescale parameter B = 3.333 so that only the one-cluster is stable with positive coupling. Then we adjusted the parameter F k (F 1 =4.950, F 2 =1.955, F 3 =3.177, F 4 =1.970) of each oscillator to have a frequency ratio with respect oscillator 1 as ω 2 /ω 1 ≈ 2.5, ω 3 /ω 1 ≈ 1.5 and ω 4 /ω 1 ≈ 2.5. Note that F k only affects the local dynamics of oscillator k and not the coupling term. Figure <ref type="figure">13 (a)</ref> shows the time series of the variable v k for K=0.234 and τ =1.65 s.</p><p>Fitting of phase dynamics. Similar to the experiments, we extract the phase of each oscillator using the peak-finding approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> from the time series of the variable v k . When there is coupling and delay, the triplet phase differences, φ j , j=1, 2, show a phase slip behavior Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">13 (b</ref>). As described in the main text we used LASSO to fit the θk values accoriding to equation (S28) with drifting in the natural frequencies. The time series of the v k variable (see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">13 (a)</ref>) showed a more nonlinear wave form, and we fitted the amplitudes of sin and cos until the seond order harmonics (C k j,2 and D k j,2 ). The θk was filtered by a first order Savitzky-Golay filter for 125 s. Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">13 (c</ref>) shows the corresponding fits for oscillator 1 to 4. (In the LASSO fit, we used a regularization parameter that represented an error 40% higher than the best fit). The fitted parameters are shown in Supplementary Fig.   The strength of the triplet interactions on oscillator k is given by the amplitudes of the first and second harmonics (H k j ); the amplitudes are shown in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">13d</ref>. In agreement with the experiments, the dynamics of oscillators 1 and 3 are impacted by both triplet interactions φ 1 and φ 2 . For oscillator 1, the amplitudes are 1.7 ×10 -3 and 1.0 ×10 -3 , and for oscillators 3 the amplitudes are 5.6 ×10 -4 and 7.4 ×10 -4 respectively. However, the dynamics of oscillator 2 and 4 are only impacted by φ 1 (2.1 ×10 -3 ) and φ 2 (1.1 ×10 -3 ).</p><p>We conclude that in an integrate-and-fire model, the phase dynamics of the oscillators coupled in a ring can be described by an emergent hypernetwork.</p></div>
