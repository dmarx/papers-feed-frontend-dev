  - Integrates with frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex.

- **Key Features**
  - Parses formats: PDF, Images, MS Office (Word, PowerPoint, Excel), HTML.
  - Exports to: Markdown, JSON, HTML.
  - Advanced AI capabilities: layout analysis (DocLayNet), table structure recognition (TableFormer), OCR, reading order, figure extraction.

- **DoclingDocument Data Model**
  - Unified representation of document features: Text, Tables, Pictures, Captions, Lists.
  - Hierarchical structure: sections, groups, headers, footers.
  - Metadata support: layout information, provenance (page numbers, document origin).

- **Pipelines and Parser Backends**
  - **Pipelines**: Orchestrate document processing, build and enrich DoclingDocument.
    - Standard-PdfPipeline: For PDF/image input.
    - SimplePipeline: For markup-based formats.
  - **Parser Backends**: Handle different document formats.
    - Low-level formats (PDF, images): Require AI methods for content recovery.
    - Markup-based formats (HTML, Office): Preserve semantics, easier to parse.

- **PDF Conversion Pipeline**
  - Custom-built PDF parser based on qpdf.
  - Retrieves text tokens and geometric properties.
  - Renders bitmap images for visual representation.
  - Supports scanned PDF documents by wrapping image formats.

- **Performance and Community Engagement**
  - Achieved 10k stars on GitHub within a month of release.
  - Recognized as the No. 1 trending repository on GitHub in November 2024.
  - Active community involvement in development and promotion.

- **Extensibility and Customization**
  - Modular architecture allows for easy addition of features and models.
  - Custom pipelines can be created by subclassing the abstract base class.

- **Lossless and Lossy Export Formats**
  - Supports lossless serialization to JSON.
  - Lossy exports to Markdown and HTML, which may not retain all metadata.

- **Chunking for RAG**
  - DoclingDocument can be processed by a chunker class for downstream applications.
  - Flexible chunking approach compatible with frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex.
