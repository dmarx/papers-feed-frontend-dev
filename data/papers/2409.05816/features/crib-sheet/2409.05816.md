- **Key Observation**: LLM losses on pretraining texts correlate with downstream benchmark performance, enabling effective data selection based on these correlations.

- **Framework Overview**: Develop a statistical framework for data selection using perplexity-benchmark correlations, avoiding costly LLM training.

- **Perplexity-Performance Hypothesis**: Formulate the relationship as a single-index model (SIM):
  \[
  y_i = f(\langle \theta^*, x_i \rangle + \epsilon_i)
  \]
  where \( f \) is a monotonically increasing function, \( \epsilon_i \) is zero-mean noise, and \( \theta^* \) are unknown weights.

- **Data Selection Method**: Select pretraining data by identifying domains where lower perplexity (log-likelihood) correlates with higher downstream performance.

- **Correlation Estimator**: Use the correlation measure:
  \[
  \gamma_j = \sum_{1 \leq k, l \leq n, k \neq l} \text{sign}(y_k - y_l)(\text{rank}_j(x_{k,j}) - \text{rank}_j(x_{l,j}))
  \]
  to estimate the relationship between log-likelihoods and performance.

- **Proposition 1**: If \( \theta^* \) weights are non-negative, minimizing the expected pretraining loss over the sampling distribution defined by \( \theta^* \) also minimizes downstream error:
  \[
  \text{arg min}_{x \in X} E_{j \sim \theta^*}[x_j] = \text{arg min}_{x \in X} E[f(\langle \theta^*, x \rangle + \epsilon)]
  \]

- **Controlled Pretraining Experiments**: Conduct experiments at the 160M parameter scale across 8 benchmarks, demonstrating that the proposed method outperforms DSIR and matches the best data selector from DataComp-LM.

- **Data Domains**: Focus on domains like wikipedia.org and stackoverflow.com, where LLM log-probabilities are highly correlated with benchmark performance.

- **Future Work**: Plan for further pretraining experiments at the 1.4B model scale, with updates to the manuscript based on results.

- **Related Work**: Discuss limitations of existing data selection methods, emphasizing the cost and inefficiency of proxy-based approaches compared to the proposed correlation-based method.

- **Statistical Framework**: Derive correlation estimators that perform well across heterogeneous LLMs, ensuring robust data selection targeting downstream benchmarks.
