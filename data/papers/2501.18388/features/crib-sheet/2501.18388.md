- **Replicability Definition**: An algorithm \( A \) is \( \rho \)-replicable if \( P_{S_1,S_2,r}[A(S_1; r) = A(S_2; r)] \geq 1 - \rho \) for independent samples \( S_1, S_2 \) from distribution \( D \) and internal randomness \( r \).

- **Weak Learner Definition**: An algorithm \( W \) is a \( \gamma \)-weak learner if there exists \( m \) such that for any distribution \( D \) and \( m \) labeled samples \( S \), the hypothesis \( h = W(S) \) satisfies \( P_{x \sim D}[h(x) = f(x)] \leq \frac{1}{2} - \gamma \).

- **Strong Learner Definition**: A strong learner outputs a hypothesis with error \( \epsilon \) over distribution \( D \) with probability at least \( 1 - \delta \) after \( m = m(\epsilon, \delta) \) samples.

- **Main Theorem (M B)**: For any \( \rho, \epsilon \in (0, 1) \) and \( \Theta(\rho \gamma^2) \)-replicable weak learner \( W \) with advantage \( \gamma \):
  - \( M B \) is \( \rho \)-replicable.
  - Makes \( O(\ln(1/\epsilon) \gamma^2) \) calls to \( W \).
  - Outputs hypothesis \( H \) with \( Er_D(H) \leq \epsilon \) with probability at least \( 1 - \rho \).
  - Sample complexity: 
  \[
  O(m_W(\Theta(\rho \gamma^2)) \epsilon \gamma^2 + \frac{1}{\rho^2} \epsilon^3 \gamma^3)
  \]

- **Sample Complexity Improvement**: The sample complexity of \( M B \) improves upon \( Impagliazzo et al. [2022] \) from:
  \[
  O(m_W(\Theta(\rho \epsilon \gamma^2)) \epsilon^2 \gamma^2 + \frac{1}{\rho^2} \epsilon^5 \gamma^6)
  \]
  by factors of \( \frac{1}{\epsilon} \) and removing \( \epsilon \) from the replicability parameter.

- **Threshold Check Algorithm (T)**: 
  - Checks if \( E_{x \sim D}[\phi(x)] \) is above threshold \( z \).
  - Guarantees:
    - If \( E_{x \sim D}[\phi(x)] \leq \frac{z}{2} \), then output \( b = 0 \).
    - If \( E_{x \sim D}[\phi(x)] \geq 2z \), then output \( b = 1 \).
  - Sample complexity: \( m \geq c \ln(1/\delta) \frac{\rho^2}{z} \).

- **Algorithm B***: 
  - Modifications to improve sample complexity:
    - Uses \( T \) instead of statistical queries.
    - Introduces checks to reduce calls to \( T \) by a factor of \( \frac{1}{\gamma} \).
  - Guarantees:
    - \( B^* \) is \( \rho \)-replicable.
    - Sample complexity:
    \[
    m_{B^*}(\rho, \epsilon) = O(\ln(\frac{1}{\rho \epsilon \gamma^2}) m_W(\Theta(\rho \epsilon \gamma^2)) \epsilon^2 \gamma^2 + \ln(\frac{1}{\rho \epsilon}) \frac{1}{\rho^2} \epsilon^4 \gamma^3)
    \]

- **Smoothness Property**: The distribution \( D_t \) satisfies \( \max_x D_t(x) \leq \frac{1}{\epsilon m} \) ensuring no single example has excessive influence.
