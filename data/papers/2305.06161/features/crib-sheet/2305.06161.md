- **Model Overview**
  - **StarCoder**: 15.5B parameters, fine-tuned on 35B Python tokens.
  - **StarCoderBase**: 15.5B parameters, trained on 1 trillion tokens from The Stack.
  - **Context Length**: 8K tokens.
  - **Inference**: Fast large-batch inference via multi-query attention.

- **Training Data**
  - **Source**: The Stack (Kocetkov et al., 2022) - permissively licensed GitHub repositories.
  - **Language Selection**: 86 programming languages based on file extension and data volume.
  - **Data Quality**: Visual inspection of 30,000 files per language; 1,000 files retained per extension.

- **Data Filtering Techniques**
  - **XML Filter**: Checks for `<?xml version=` in the first 100 characters.
  - **Alpha Filter**: Removes files with <25% alphabetic characters; manual verification for high false positive rates.
  - **HTML Filter**: Retains files with at least 20% visible text and minimum length of 100 characters.
  - **JSON/YAML Filters**: 
    - **YAML**: Files with 50-5000 characters, avg. line length <100, max line length <1000, >50% alphabetic characters.
    - **JSON**: Files with 50-5000 characters, >50% alphabetic characters.

- **Performance Evaluation**
  - **StarCoder vs. Other Models**: Outperforms all open Code LLMs and matches OpenAI's code-cushman-001.
  - **Multi-language Support**: Retains performance across multiple programming languages.

- **Legal and Ethical Considerations**
  - **Copyright Issues**: Fair-use doctrine implications for training data; lawsuits against GitHub Copilot.
  - **Privacy Concerns**: Compliance with GDPR; need for explicit consent and transparency in data processing.

- **Community and Open Access**
  - **Open-Access Definition**: Models with public weights; varying levels of openness in existing models.
  - **Community Involvement**: Emphasis on community-driven development and external audits.

- **Key Metrics from Training Data**
  - **Volume and File Count**: Overview of selected programming languages, their file counts, and data volumes post-filtering (e.g., Python: 12,962,249 files, 64.30% of total volume).
