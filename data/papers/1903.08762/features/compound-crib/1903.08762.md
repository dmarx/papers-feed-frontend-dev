## Detailed Technical Explanations and Justifications

### Importance of Quantile Metrics in A/B Testing

Quantile metrics, such as the 90th percentile (p90) and 50th percentile (p50), are critical in A/B testing, particularly for performance metrics like page load time. The rationale for using quantiles over averages is rooted in the nature of performance data, which often exhibits skewness and heavy tails. 

1. **Non-Normal Distribution**: Performance metrics like page load times are typically not normally distributed. They can have long tails where a small percentage of requests take significantly longer than the majority. Averages can be heavily influenced by these outliers, leading to misleading conclusions about user experience.

2. **User Experience**: Users are more affected by the worst experiences than by average experiences. For instance, if a website has an average load time of 2 seconds but 10% of users experience load times of 10 seconds, the average does not reflect the negative experience of those users. Quantiles provide a more accurate representation of the user experience by focusing on the worst-case scenarios (e.g., p90).

3. **Optimization Goals**: Many optimization goals in web performance focus on reducing the load time for the slowest requests. By measuring p90 or p50, organizations can directly assess the impact of changes on the user experience, ensuring that improvements are made where they matter most.

### Challenges with Existing Methodologies

1. **Bootstrap Method**: 
   - **Statistical Validity**: The bootstrap method is a resampling technique that provides valid statistical estimates. However, it is computationally intensive, especially with large datasets typical in A/B testing environments. The time required for computation can extend to days, making it impractical for real-time decision-making.
   - **Dependency Structure**: The bootstrap must be applied at the member level to maintain the dependency structure of the data, complicating the implementation.

2. **Asymptotic Variance Estimate**:
   - **Scalability**: While asymptotic variance estimates are computationally efficient, they often rely on the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples. In practice, this assumption is violated in A/B testing scenarios where page load times from the same user are correlated.
   - **Underestimation of Variance**: The reliance on i.i.d. assumptions leads to significant underestimation of variance, inflating false positive rates. For example, a nominal false positive rate of 5% can result in actual false positive rates as high as 61%, which can mislead decision-makers.

### Proposed Methodology Overview

The proposed methodology addresses the limitations of existing approaches by providing a statistically valid and scalable method for A/B testing with quantiles. 

1. **Speed and Efficiency**: The methodology achieves over 500x speedup compared to the bootstrap method, allowing for timely insights that align with the fast-paced nature of product development cycles.

2. **Statistical Validity**: The method maintains a low probability (2%) of differing from bootstrap estimates, ensuring that the results are reliable and can be used for decision-making.

### Key Notations

- **Page Load Time**: Let \( X_{i,j} \) represent the page load time for member \( i \) and page view \( j \).
- **Sample Quantile**: The sample quantile \( Q \) is the value below which a given percentage of observations fall.
- **Variance and Standard Deviation**: The variance \( \text{var}(Q) \) and standard deviation \( \text{stddev}(Q) \) of the sample quantile are crucial for estimating the uncertainty around the quantile estimates.

### Statistical Validity Requirements

To ensure that A/B testing results are actionable, the estimates of sample quantiles and their standard deviations must be statistically valid. This means that the methodology must accurately reflect the underlying distribution of the data and account for dependencies among observations.

### Asymptotic Distribution Derivation

The derivation of the asymptotic distribution for quantiles leverages the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) without assuming i.i.d. samples. 

1. **Key Equations**:
   - The asymptotic distribution of the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) is given by:
     \[
     \sqrt{n}(F_n(x) - F(x)) \xrightarrow{D} N(0, \sigma^2_{P,J})
     \]
   - For the quantile, the asymptotic behavior is:
     \[
     \sqrt{n}(Q - Q) \xrightarrow{D} N(0, \sigma^2_{P,J} f_X(Q)^2)
     \]
   These equations establish the foundation for estimating the variance of quantiles in a non-i.i.d. context.
