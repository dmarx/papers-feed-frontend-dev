- **Importance of Quantile Metrics in A/B Testing**: Quantile metrics (e.g., p90, p50) are essential for measuring performance metrics like page load time, which cannot be accurately summarized by averages alone.

- **Challenges with Existing Methodologies**: 
  - Bootstrap: Statistically valid but computationally expensive (days to compute).
  - Asymptotic variance estimate: Scalable but leads to significant underestimation of variance, inflating false positive rates.

- **Proposed Methodology Overview**: 
  - A statistically valid and scalable method for A/B testing with quantiles, achieving over 500x speedup compared to bootstrap with only a 2% chance of differing from bootstrap estimates.

- **Key Notations**:
  - Let \( X_{i,j} \) be the page load time for member \( i \) and page view \( j \).
  - Sample quantile \( Q \) and its variance \( \text{var}(Q) \) and standard deviation \( \text{stddev}(Q) \).

- **Statistical Validity Requirements**: 
  - Estimates of sample quantile and standard deviation must be valid to ensure correct decision-making in A/B tests.

- **Asymptotic Distribution Derivation**:
  - Central Limit Theorem applied to derive the asymptotic distribution of quantiles without the i.i.d. assumption.
  - Key equations:
    - \( \sqrt{n}(F_n(x) - F(x)) \xrightarrow{D} N(0, \sigma^2_{P,J}) \)
    - \( \sqrt{n}(Q - Q) \xrightarrow{D} N(0, \sigma^2_{P,J} f_X(Q)^2) \)

- **Dynamic Interval Width for Variance Estimation**: 
  - Default interval size set to ±50ms; improved to ±2×stddev for better accuracy, reducing error rate from 11% to 2%.

- **Implementation Insights**: 
  - A data pipeline was developed to apply the proposed methodology, emphasizing the need for optimizations to handle large-scale data efficiently.

- **Numerical Results**: 
  - Comparison of proposed methodology against bootstrap using 242 real experiments, confirming statistical validity and low false positive rates.

- **Applications Beyond Performance Metrics**: 
  - Quantile metrics can be used to monitor distribution impacts in various contexts, such as revenue distribution in e-commerce.

- **Conclusion**: 
  - The proposed methodology enables effective A/B testing with quantile metrics, addressing previous limitations and enhancing decision-making capabilities in large-scale online experimentation.
