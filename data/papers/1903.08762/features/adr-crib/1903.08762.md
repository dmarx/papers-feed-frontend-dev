Hereâ€™s a detailed technical explanation and rationale for the researchers' decisions regarding the various aspects of their methodology for A/B testing with quantile metrics:

### 1. Decision to Adopt Quantile Metrics for A/B Testing
Quantile metrics, such as the 90th percentile (p90) and 50th percentile (p50), provide a more nuanced understanding of performance metrics like page load time. Unlike average metrics, quantiles capture the distribution of data, allowing for the identification of outliers and tail performance, which is critical for user experience. This decision is justified by the need to optimize for user experience rather than just average performance, as demonstrated by the example of two websites with the same average load time but vastly different user experiences.

### 2. Choice of Statistical Methodology for Quantile Estimation
The researchers opted for a methodology that combines statistical validity with scalability. Traditional methods like bootstrap provide valid estimates but are computationally expensive, while asymptotic methods assuming independence can lead to significant underestimation of variance. The chosen methodology aims to leverage the strengths of both approaches, ensuring that the quantile estimates are both accurate and computationally feasible for large datasets.

### 3. Selection of Bootstrap Method for Variance Estimation
Bootstrap methods are selected for their ability to provide valid variance estimates for quantiles, especially in the presence of dependent samples. By resampling at the member level, the bootstrap method preserves the correlation structure of page load times, which is crucial for accurate variance estimation. This choice is essential for maintaining the integrity of statistical significance in A/B testing results.

### 4. Decision to Implement a Dynamic Interval Width for Density Estimation
The dynamic interval width for density estimation is implemented to improve the accuracy of variance estimates. By adjusting the interval based on the estimated standard deviation, the researchers can balance bias and variance more effectively. This approach allows for better density estimation in regions with fewer data points, particularly in the tails of the distribution, which is critical for quantile metrics.

### 5. Choice of Randomization Unit in Experiments
The randomization unit is chosen to be the member level, which ensures that the independence assumption holds true across different members. This choice is crucial for the validity of the statistical methods employed, as it allows for accurate estimation of quantiles and their variances without violating the independence assumptions necessary for the chosen statistical methodologies.

### 6. Decision to Prioritize Statistical Validity Over Computational Speed
The researchers prioritize statistical validity to ensure that the A/B testing results are reliable and can drive data-driven decision-making. While computational speed is important, the consequences of false positives or inaccurate estimates can lead to misguided business decisions. Therefore, ensuring the statistical integrity of the results takes precedence.

### 7. Choice of Metrics to Monitor Alongside Quantile Metrics
In addition to quantile metrics, the researchers monitor average metrics and other relevant performance indicators. This holistic approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of the impact of changes made during A/B testing, ensuring that both overall performance and tail performance are considered in the analysis.

### 8. Decision to Optimize the Data Pipeline for Scalability
Given the large volume of data processed daily (300 billion rows), optimizing the data pipeline for scalability is essential. This decision ensures that the A/B testing platform can handle the demands of real-time analysis and reporting, enabling timely insights that align with the fast-paced product innovation cycle.

### 9. Selection of Programming Languages and Tools for Implementation
The choice of programming languages and tools is driven by the need for efficiency, scalability, and ease of integration with existing systems. The researchers likely selected languages and tools that are well-suited for data processing and statistical analysis, ensuring that the implementation can handle large datasets effectively.

### 10. Decision to Validate Methodology Using Real Experiment Data
Validating the methodology with real experiment data is crucial for establishing its effectiveness and reliability. This decision allows the researchers to assess the performance of their proposed methods in practical scenarios, ensuring that the results are applicable to real-world A/B testing situations.

### 11. Choice of Error Margin Acceptable for Statistical Significance
The researchers set an acceptable error margin for statistical significance to balance the risk of false positives with the need for actionable insights. By carefully selecting this threshold, they ensure that the results are both statistically valid and relevant for decision-making.

### 12. Decision to Compare Proposed Methodology Against Existing Methods
Comparing the proposed methodology against existing methods is essential for demonstrating its advantages in terms of statistical validity and computational efficiency. This decision provides a benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of the new approach and justifies its adoption.

### 13. Choice of Sample Size for Experiments
The choice of sample size is determined by the need to achieve sufficient statistical power while considering practical constraints such as time and resources. A larger sample size increases the reliability of the results, particularly for quantile metrics, which can be sensitive to sample variability.

### 14. Decision to Use a Closed-Form Asymptotic Distribution for Quantile Estimation
