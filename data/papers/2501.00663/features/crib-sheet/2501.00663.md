- **Titans Architecture Overview**
  - Introduces a new family of architectures that incorporate both short-term and long-term memory.
  - Composed of three main components:
    - **Core**: Short-term memory using attention with limited context.
    - **Long-term Memory**: Neural long-term memory module for storing historical data.
    - **Persistent Memory**: Learnable parameters that encode task knowledge.

- **Neural Long-Term Memory Module**
  - Designed to learn how to memorize/store data at test time.
  - Inspired by human long-term memory; emphasizes memorization of surprising events.
  - Utilizes a decay mechanism for memory management, balancing memory size and data surprise.

- **Attention Mechanism**
  - Standard attention computes output based on query (Q), key (K), and value (V) matrices:
    - \( Q = xW_Q, K = xW_K, V = xW_V \)
    - Output: 
      \[
      y_i = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{i} \exp\left(\frac{Q_i^T K_j}{\sqrt{d_{in}}}\right) V_j}{\sum_{l=1}^{i} \exp\left(\frac{Q_i^T K_l}{\sqrt{d_{in}}}\right)}
      \]

- **Efficiency of Titans**
  - Titans outperform traditional Transformers and linear recurrent models in various tasks.
  - Capable of scaling to context window sizes larger than 2M while maintaining high accuracy.

- **Experimental Results**
  - Demonstrated superior performance in language modeling, commonsense reasoning, and time series forecasting.
  - Titans show competitive results against Transformers using full context while being more efficient.

- **Memory Perspective in Learning**
  - Memory is viewed as a multi-faceted system (short-term, long-term, etc.) that operates independently yet interconnectively.
  - Effective architectures should incorporate distinct memory modules to enhance learning processes.

- **Key Questions Addressed**
  - What constitutes a good memory structure?
  - What is an effective memory update mechanism?
  - How to design an architecture that integrates different memory modules?

- **Gradient-Based Surprise Measurement**
  - Surprise of an input is measured using the gradient of the neural network concerning the input, aiding in memory retention.

- **Kernel-Based Attention Mechanism**
  - Replaces softmax in attention with a kernel function to improve efficiency:
    \[
    y_i = \sum_{j=1}^{i} \phi(Q_i^T K_j) V_j
    \]
  - Allows for higher throughput and reduced memory consumption.

- **Decaying Mechanism for Memory Management**
  - Generalizes the forgetting mechanism in recurrent models, optimizing memory usage during training.

- **Training Algorithm**
  - Fast and parallelizable training algorithm for the deep neural long-term memory, leveraging mini-batch gradient descent and momentum.

- **Notation and Definitions**
  - Input: \( x \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d_{in}} \)
  - Memory module: \( M \)
  - Attention mask: \( M \)
  - Segmentation: \( S(i) \) refers to the \( i \)-th segment of the input.
