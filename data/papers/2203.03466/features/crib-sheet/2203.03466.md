- **Maximal Update Parametrization (µP)**: A new parametrization that stabilizes optimal hyperparameters (HPs) across varying model sizes, enabling effective zero-shot HP transfer.
  
- **µTransfer Technique**: A hyperparameter tuning paradigm that allows tuning on a smaller model and transferring those HPs to a larger model without direct tuning.

- **Key Benefits of µTransfer**:
  - **Performance Improvement**: Outperforms larger models (e.g., BERT-large, GPT-3) using HPs tuned on smaller models.
  - **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces tuning costs significantly (e.g., 7% of total pretraining cost for GPT-3).
  - **Single Tuning for Model Families**: Allows tuning one small model to apply HPs across a family of models with varying sizes.

- **HP Stability**: In µP, optimal learning rates remain stable across model widths, unlike in standard parametrization (SP) where they shift significantly.

- **Algorithm Overview**: 
  - **Input**: Small model with tuned HPs.
  - **Process**: Transfer HPs to the large model using µP.
  - **Output**: Large model with near-optimal HPs without direct tuning.

- **Empirical Validation**: Verified on Transformer and ResNet architectures, demonstrating effective HP transfer across different model sizes.

- **Implementation**: Available as a PyTorch package (`pip install mup`), facilitating easy adoption of the µTransfer technique.

- **Parametrization Comparison**:
  - **µP vs. SP**: µP maintains a well-defined infinite-width limit, while SP leads to instability in larger models.
  
- **Hyperparameter Table**: Key hyperparameters for tuning summarized in Table 2, including learning rate, batch size, and others.

- **Theoretical Foundation**: Based on the Central Limit Theorem, the correct parametrization allows for effective HP transfer across model sizes.

- **Experimental Setup**: Details on the training process, datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10), and model configurations used for validation.

- **Future Work**: Potential applications of µTransfer in various deep learning tasks and further exploration of HP stability across different architectures.
