- **GRB 240825A Overview**
  - Detected by Fermi GBM and LAT on August 25, 2024.
  - Redshift: \( z = 0.659 \).

- **Spectral Components**
  - Extra hard component detected, peaking at approximately 50 MeV.
  - Broken power-law model fits better than single power-law with exponential cutoff (CPL).

- **Key Models**
  - **Band Function**: Empirical function with indices \( \alpha \sim -1 \) and \( \beta \sim -2.5 \).
  - **CPL Model**: 
    \[
    N(E) = B E^{\alpha_1} \exp\left(-\frac{E}{E_{\text{cut}}}\right)
    \]
    - \( E_{\text{cut}} = 50.74^{+29.64}_{-16.11} \) MeV, \( \alpha_1 = 1.09^{+0.26}_{-0.38} \).
  - **Broken Power-Law (BPL) Model**:
    \[
    N(E) = 
    \begin{cases} 
    C E^{\alpha_l} & \text{if } E \leq E_{\text{break}} \\ 
    C E^{\alpha_l - \alpha_h} E_{\text{break}}^{\alpha_h} & \text{if } E > E_{\text{break}} 
    \end{cases}
    \]
    - \( E_{\text{break}} = 35.71^{+14.29}_{-15.08} \) MeV, \( \alpha_l = -1.23^{+0.31}_{-0.12} \), \( \alpha_h = -3.00^{+0.36}_{-0.44} \).

- **Fit Comparisons**
  - Band+CPL model: \( \text{PGSTAT}/\text{dof} = 574.96/362 \).
  - Band+BPL model shows better fit with lower BIC value: \( \Delta \text{BIC} = 4.24 \) (positive evidence against Band+CPL).

- **Temporal Analysis**
  - Light curve shows two distinct peaks in low-energy GBM emission.
  - High-energy emissions (10-40 MeV and 0.1-100 GeV) delayed by approximately 0.6 s compared to low-energy emissions.

- **Observational Data**
  - GBM light curve duration \( T_{90} \approx 4 \) s in 50-300 keV.
  - Total LAT counts: 284 in the first 10 s, 324 in 2000 s post-trigger.

- **Theoretical Implications**
  - Challenges synchrotron self-Compton origin for the extra component.
  - Suggests alternative scenarios like inverse Compton scattering of photospheric emission.
