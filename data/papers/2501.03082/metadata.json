  "abstract": "An extra hard spectral component that extends to GeV energies, in additional\nto the typical sub- MeV Band component, appears in several gamma-ray burst\n(GRBs) detected by Fermi Large Area Telescopes (LAT). Only in one case (i.e.,\nGRB 090926A), a spectral break feature at the high energy end is identified in\nthe extra hard component, but the photon counts are not enough to distinguish\nbetween the cutoff model and the broken power law model for the spectral break.\nIn this work, we report the detection of an extra hard component showing the\nspectral break in GRB 240825A. We find that a broken power-law model fits the\nspectral data of the extra component better than a single power-law with an\nexponential cutoff in the time resolved spectrum for the second emission pulse,\nwith a break at about 50 MeV. This spectral feature disfavors the gamma-ray\nopacity to pair creation as the origin of the spectral break, but points to an\nintrinsic peak for the extra component. The low ratio between the peak of the\nextra hard component and that of the Band component challenges the synchrotron\nself-Compton origin for the extra component. Alternative scenarios, such as the\ninverse Compton scattering of the photosphere emission, are discussed. In\naddition, we find a clear transition from the prompt emission to afterglow\nemission at GeV energies in GRB 240825A, manifested by a temporal steep decay\nand an unique spectral evolution.",
