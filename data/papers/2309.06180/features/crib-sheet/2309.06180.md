- **PagedAttention Overview**: An attention algorithm inspired by virtual memory and paging techniques to manage KV cache memory efficiently in LLMs.
  
- **Key Contributions**:
  - Identifies challenges in memory allocation for LLM serving.
  - Proposes PagedAttention for non-contiguous KV cache storage.
  - Implements vLLM, a high-throughput LLM serving engine.

- **Memory Management Issues**:
  - **Internal Fragmentation**: Pre-allocating contiguous memory for KV cache leads to wasted space when actual usage is less than maximum allocation.
  - **External Fragmentation**: Different pre-allocated sizes for requests prevent efficient memory utilization.

- **PagedAttention Mechanism**:
  - Divides KV cache into fixed-size blocks (pages) to allow flexible allocation.
  - Blocks can be allocated on demand, reducing internal fragmentation.
  - Enables memory sharing across requests and sequences.

- **vLLM Performance**:
  - Achieves 2-4Ã— throughput improvement over state-of-the-art systems (FasterTransformer, Orca) without affecting model accuracy.
  - More significant improvements observed with longer sequences and larger models.

- **LLM Serving Process**:
  - **Prompt Phase**: Computes probabilities for the first new token using the entire prompt, allowing parallel processing.
  - **Autoregressive Generation Phase**: Generates tokens sequentially, leading to memory-bound operations and latency.

- **Batching Techniques**:
  - Fine-grained batching (e.g., cellular batching, iteration-level scheduling) reduces queueing delays and avoids padding inefficiencies.
  - Allows new requests to be processed after a single iteration, improving throughput.

- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Throughput measured in tokens per second (token/s).
  - Memory usage efficiency quantified through KV cache utilization percentages.

- **Source Code Availability**: vLLM's implementation is publicly accessible at [GitHub](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm).
