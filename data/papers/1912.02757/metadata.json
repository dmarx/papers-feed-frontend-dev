  "abstract": "Deep ensembles have been empirically shown to be a promising approach for\nimproving accuracy, uncertainty and out-of-distribution robustness of deep\nlearning models. While deep ensembles were theoretically motivated by the\nbootstrap, non-bootstrap ensembles trained with just random initialization also\nperform well in practice, which suggests that there could be other explanations\nfor why deep ensembles work well. Bayesian neural networks, which learn\ndistributions over the parameters of the network, are theoretically\nwell-motivated by Bayesian principles, but do not perform as well as deep\nensembles in practice, particularly under dataset shift. One possible\nexplanation for this gap between theory and practice is that popular scalable\nvariational Bayesian methods tend to focus on a single mode, whereas deep\nensembles tend to explore diverse modes in function space. We investigate this\nhypothesis by building on recent work on understanding the loss landscape of\nneural networks and adding our own exploration to measure the similarity of\nfunctions in the space of predictions. Our results show that random\ninitializations explore entirely different modes, while functions along an\noptimization trajectory or sampled from the subspace thereof cluster within a\nsingle mode predictions-wise, while often deviating significantly in the weight\nspace. Developing the concept of the diversity--accuracy plane, we show that\nthe decorrelation power of random initializations is unmatched by popular\nsubspace sampling methods. Finally, we evaluate the relative effects of\nensembling, subspace based methods and ensembles of subspace based methods, and\nthe experimental results validate our hypothesis.",
