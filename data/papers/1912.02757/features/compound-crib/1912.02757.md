## Detailed Technical Explanations and Justifications for Research Decisions

### Deep Ensembles Overview
Deep ensembles are a method for improving the performance of deep learning models by training multiple networks with different random initializations. This approach is inspired by the bootstrap method, which emphasizes the importance of sampling in statistical inference. The rationale behind using deep ensembles is that they can empirically enhance accuracy, uncertainty estimation, and robustness against adversarial attacks or dataset shifts. The effectiveness of random initialization in producing diverse models suggests that the ensemble's performance is not solely reliant on the bootstrap but rather on the inherent diversity achieved through different starting points in the optimization landscape.

### Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs)
Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) aim to learn a distribution over the model parameters, allowing for uncertainty quantification. The Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation provides a point estimate of the parameters, which is computationally efficient but fails to capture the full distributional information. This limitation is significant because it restricts the model's ability to express uncertainty, particularly in scenarios where the data is limited or when the model encounters out-of-distribution inputs. The decision to compare BNNs with deep ensembles stems from the observation that while BNNs are theoretically sound, they often underperform in practice, especially in terms of uncertainty quantification and robustness.

### Loss Landscape
The loss landscape of neural networks is a high-dimensional space that can exhibit complex behavior. Empirical studies have shown that the loss decreases monotonically along linear paths in this space, indicating that optimization trajectories are generally smooth. This property is crucial for understanding how different initializations and training paths can lead to diverse solutions. The decision to investigate the loss landscape is motivated by the hypothesis that the diversity of solutions in deep ensembles arises from exploring different regions of this landscape, which is not fully captured by BNNs that may converge to a single mode.

### Diversity-Accuracy Plane
The diversity-accuracy plane is a conceptual framework developed to illustrate the relationship between the diversity of predictions made by an ensemble and its overall accuracy. This plane helps to visualize how increasing diversity among the models in an ensemble can lead to improved accuracy, particularly in challenging scenarios such as dataset shifts. The decision to introduce this concept is rooted in the need to quantify and understand the trade-offs between diversity and accuracy, which can inform the design of more effective ensemble methods.

### Function Space Diversity
The exploration of function space diversity is critical for understanding how different initializations can lead to varied predictions. Random initializations allow models to explore different modes in the function space, while models trained along a single trajectory or subspace tend to yield similar predictions. This observation supports the idea that deep ensembles, by leveraging multiple initializations, can capture a broader range of functions, enhancing their robustness and uncertainty estimates. The decision to focus on function space diversity stems from the need to explain the empirical success of deep ensembles compared to BNNs.

### Similarity Metrics
The use of similarity metrics, such as cosine similarity in weight space and disagreement in function space, provides quantitative measures to assess the diversity of models. Cosine similarity helps to evaluate how similar the weight configurations of different models are, while the disagreement metric quantifies the extent to which different models produce varying predictions on the same inputs. These metrics are essential for validating the hypothesis that diverse initializations lead to diverse predictions, thereby justifying the effectiveness of deep ensembles.

### Subspace Sampling Methods
Subspace sampling methods, including random subspace, dropout subspace, diagonal Gaussian, and low-rank Gaussian, are employed to explore the diversity of predictions within constrained regions of the weight space. Each method offers a different approach to sampling, with random subspace providing a non-parametric approximation to the posterior, while dropout and Gaussian methods assume specific parametric forms. The decision to compare these methods is driven by the need to understand how well they capture the diversity of predictions compared to the more straightforward approach of using random initializations.

### Empirical Findings
The empirical findings indicate that random initializations yield diverse solutions, while subspace methods often result in clustered predictions. This observation is critical for understanding the practical implications of the theoretical concepts discussed. The decision to highlight these findings is based on the need to provide evidence for the superiority of deep ensembles over BNNs, particularly in terms of accuracy and uncertainty under dataset shifts.

### Evaluation Datasets
The choice of evaluation datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, is motivated by the need to assess the performance of the proposed methods across a range of complexities and challenges. Additionally, evaluating on corrupted datasets (CIFAR-10-C, ImageNet-C) allows for a robust assessment of the models' performance under adverse conditions, further validating the effectiveness of deep ensembles.
