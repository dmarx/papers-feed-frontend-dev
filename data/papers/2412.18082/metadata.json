  "abstract": "The item cold-start problem is crucial for online recommender systems, as the\nsuccess of the cold-start phase determines whether items can transition into\npopular ones. Prompt learning, a powerful technique used in natural language\nprocessing (NLP) to address zero- or few-shot problems, has been adapted for\nrecommender systems to tackle similar challenges. However, existing methods\ntypically rely on content-based properties or text descriptions for prompting,\nwhich we argue may be suboptimal for cold-start recommendations due to 1)\nsemantic gaps with recommender tasks, 2) model bias caused by warm-up items\ncontribute most of the positive feedback to the model, which is the core of the\ncold-start problem that hinders the recommender quality on cold-start items. We\npropose to leverage high-value positive feedback, termed pinnacle feedback as\nprompt information, to simultaneously resolve the above two problems. We\nexperimentally prove that compared to the content description proposed in\nexisting works, the positive feedback is more suitable to serve as prompt\ninformation by bridging the semantic gaps. Besides, we propose item-wise\npersonalized prompt networks to encode pinnaclce feedback to relieve the model\nbias by the positive feedback dominance problem. Extensive experiments on four\nreal-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over\nstate-of-the-art methods. Moreover, PROMO has been successfully deployed on a\npopular short-video sharing platform, a billion-user scale commercial\nshort-video application, achieving remarkable performance gains across various\ncommercial metrics within cold-start scenarios",
