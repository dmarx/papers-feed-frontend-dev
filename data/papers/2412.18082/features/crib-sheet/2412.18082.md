- **Item Cold-start Problem**: Critical phase in online recommender systems where new items lack prior interactions, necessitating effective scoring functions to estimate user preferences.

- **Pinnacle Feedback**: High-value positive feedback proposed as prompt information to address semantic gaps and model bias in cold-start recommendations.

- **PROMO Framework**: A prompt-tuning method designed for item cold-start recommendations, utilizing pinnacle feedback and personalized prompt networks to enhance model performance.

- **Key Contributions**:
  - Identification of challenges in prompt-tuning for cold-start recommendations: data cost and model bias.
  - Introduction of pinnacle feedback as a cost-effective prompt source.
  - Development of personalized prompt networks to mitigate bias towards warm-start items.
  - Implementation of two types of prompt-enhanced loss functions to improve recommendation quality.

- **Model Architecture**:
  - **Embedding Layer**: Transforms item ID and content features into low-dimensional vectors for input into the model.
  - **Backbone Model**: Utilizes SASRec (or other models) to encode user behavior sequences through stacked Transformer blocks.
  - **Prediction Mechanism**: Computes predicted interaction likelihood using the formula:
    \[
    ŷ_{u,i} = \sigma [h_u]^\top \cdot h_i \cdot \tau
    \]
    where \( \sigma \) is the sigmoid function, and \( \tau \) is the temperature coefficient.

- **Loss Function**: Negative log-likelihood function defined as:
  \[
  L = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{(u,i,y) \in D_{train}} \left( y_{u,i} \log ŷ_{u,i} + (1 - y_{u,i}) \log(1 - ŷ_{u,i}) \right)
  \]

- **Experimental Validation**: Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate PROMO's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in cold-start scenarios.

- **Real-world Application**: Successful deployment of PROMO on a billion-user scale short-video sharing platform, achieving significant performance improvements across various metrics.
