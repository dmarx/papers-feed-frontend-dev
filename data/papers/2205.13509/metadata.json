  "abstract": "The presence of obstacles is intuitively expected to hinder the diffusive\ntransport of micro-swimmers. However, for chiral micro-swimmers, a low density\nof obstacles near a surface can enhance their diffusive behavior, due to the\nrectification of the chiral motion by the obstacles. Here, we study numerically\nthe role that disorder plays in determining the transport dynamics of chiral\nmicro-swimmers on surfaces with obstacles. We consider different densities of\nregularly spaced obstacles and distinct types of disorder: noise in the\ndynamics of the micro-swimmer, quenched noise in the positions of the obstacles\nas well as obstacle size polydispersity. We show that, depending on the type\nand strength of the disorder, the presence of obstacles can either enhance or\nhinder transport, and discuss implications for the control of active transport\nin disordered media.",
