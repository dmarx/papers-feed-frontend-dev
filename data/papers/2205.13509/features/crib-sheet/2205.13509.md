- **Chiral Swimmers**: Defined as active Brownian particles or run-and-tumble dynamics; exhibit circular trajectories near surfaces due to hydrodynamic interactions.
  
- **Disorder Types**: 
  - **Dynamic Noise**: Perturbs swimmer's reorientation (rotational Brownian diffusion).
  - **Quenched Noise**: 
    - Positional disorder of obstacles.
    - Size polydispersity of obstacles.

- **Effective Diffusion Coefficient (D)**: Quantifies transport properties; calculated from mean square displacement (MSD):
  \[
  MSD(t) \sim 4Dt, \quad t \to \infty
  \]

- **Obstacle Density (ρ)**: Defined as the percentage of surface area covered by obstacles:
  \[
  ρ = \frac{N_o \pi \sigma^2}{L^2} \times 100\%
  \]

- **Weeks-Chandler-Anderson Potential**: Governs interactions between swimmer and obstacles:
  \[
  V(r_i) = 
  \begin{cases} 
  4\left(\frac{\sigma}{r_i}\right)^{12} - \left(\frac{\sigma}{r_i}\right)^{6} + 1 & \text{for } r_i < 2\sigma \\
  0 & \text{for } r_i \geq 2\sigma 
  \end{cases}
  \]

- **Trajectory Equations**: Govern swimmer's motion:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  \frac{dx}{dt} &= v \cos(\phi) + F_x \\
  \frac{dy}{dt} &= v \sin(\phi) + F_y \\
  \frac{d\phi}{dt} &= \omega + 2D_R \xi_\phi
  \end{align*}
  \]

- **Mean Square Displacement (MSD)**: 
  \[
  MSD(t) = [R(t) - R(0)]^2
  \]

- **Non-monotonic Diffusivity**: Observed with increasing obstacle density; enhanced at low densities due to rectification of chiral motion, reduced at high densities due to caging effects.

- **Ideal Chiral Swimmer**: Moves in circular orbits in homogeneous environments; exhibits periodic orbits in heterogeneous environments, particularly at obstacle densities around ρ = 9.5%.

- **Dynamic Noise Effects**: 
  - At low noise strengths, enhances diffusivity by perturbing localized orbits.
  - At high densities, leads to caging and reduced diffusivity.

- **Simulation Parameters**: 
  - Number of obstacles \(N_o = 400\).
  - Time step \(\Delta t = 10^{-4}\).
  - Simulation duration \(t = 4800 \frac{\sigma}{v}\).

- **Key Findings**: 
  - Low density of obstacles can enhance transport for chiral swimmers.
  - High density leads to hindered transport due to constant interactions with obstacles.
  - Dynamic noise can enhance exploration in low-density scenarios but suppresses guided transport at high densities.
