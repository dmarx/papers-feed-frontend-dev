the swimmer, but as the density increases, the interaction between the swimmer and the obstacles becomes more complex, leading to the emergence of distinct transport regimes.

### Detailed Technical Explanations/Justifications/Rationale

1. **Decision on the Type of Chiral Swimmer Model to Use**:
   The choice of a spherically shaped chiral swimmer is motivated by its relevance to biological systems, such as E. coli, which exhibit chiral motion due to their flagellar propulsion. The model captures essential features of chiral motion while allowing for the introduction of noise and interactions with obstacles, making it suitable for studying the effects of disorder on transport dynamics.

2. **Choice of Obstacle Arrangement and Density**:
   A periodic arrangement of obstacles is selected to systematically investigate the effects of density on swimmer dynamics. The density is varied to explore different transport regimes, from low densities where rectification occurs to high densities where caging effects dominate. This arrangement allows for controlled studies of how spatial organization influences swimmer behavior.

3. **Selection of Noise Types to Introduce (Dynamic vs. Quenched)**:
   Dynamic noise represents fluctuations in the swimmer's orientation, mimicking biological variability in swimming direction. Quenched noise, on the other hand, introduces disorder in the obstacle arrangement and size, reflecting real-world scenarios where obstacles are not uniformly distributed. This dual approach enables a comprehensive understanding of how different types of noise affect transport properties.

4. **Method for Quantifying Transport Properties (Effective Diffusion Coefficient)**:
   The effective diffusion coefficient is a standard metric for characterizing transport in stochastic systems. By analyzing the mean square displacement (MSD) of the swimmer, the study quantifies how the presence of obstacles and noise influences the swimmer's ability to explore space. This method provides a clear, quantitative measure of the impact of disorder on transport dynamics.

5. **Approach for Simulating Swimmer Trajectories**:
   The simulation of swimmer trajectories is based on integrating the equations of motion that account for both deterministic and stochastic components. This approach captures the essential dynamics of the swimmer while allowing for the introduction of interactions with obstacles, providing a realistic representation of swimmer behavior in a disordered environment.

6. **Decision on the Integration Method for Trajectory Calculations**:
   A second-order Runge-Kutta scheme is chosen for its balance between computational efficiency and accuracy. This method is particularly suitable for systems with high obstacle densities, where stability in numerical integration is crucial to avoid artifacts in the trajectory calculations.

7. **Choice of Potential Model for Swimmer-Obstacle Interactions**:
   The Weeks-Chandler-Andersen potential is selected for its ability to model short-range repulsive interactions while avoiding unphysical overlaps. This potential is well-suited for capturing the interactions between the swimmer and obstacles, reflecting the physical reality of hard-sphere interactions in colloidal systems.

8. **Parameters for the Simulation Box Size and Obstacle Dimensions**:
   The simulation box size and obstacle dimensions are chosen to ensure that the swimmer can explore a sufficiently large area while maintaining a realistic density of obstacles. The parameters are set to reflect typical sizes found in biological systems, allowing for direct comparisons with experimental observations.

9. **Criteria for Defining the Initial Conditions of the Swimmer**:
   The initial conditions are defined to ensure that the swimmer does not overlap with any obstacles, which is critical for realistic simulations. Randomly selecting the initial position within the constraints of the obstacle arrangement allows for a diverse set of trajectories, enhancing the statistical robustness of the results.

10. **Strategy for Averaging Over Multiple Trajectories and Configurations**:
    Averaging over multiple trajectories and obstacle configurations is essential to obtain reliable statistical measures of transport properties. This approach mitigates the effects of outliers and ensures that the results are representative of the underlying dynamics, particularly in disordered systems.

11. **Decision on the Time Evolution Parameters for Simulations**:
    The choice of time evolution parameters, including the simulation duration and time step size, is guided by the need to capture long-time diffusion behavior while ensuring numerical stability. The parameters are selected to allow sufficient time for the swimmer to explore the system and for the MSD to converge.

12. **Choice of Metrics for Analyzing Mean Square Displacement**:
    The mean square displacement is analyzed to extract the effective diffusion coefficient, providing insights into the transport dynamics of the swimmer. This metric is widely used in the study of stochastic processes and is particularly relevant for characterizing the effects of disorder on diffusion.

13. **Selection of Statistical Methods for Data Analysis**:
    Linear regression is employed to extract the effective diffusion coefficient from the MSD data, providing a straightforward method for quantifying transport properties. This approach is complemented by statistical measures to assess the significance of the results and to identify trends in the data.

14. **Decision on the Interpretation of Non-Monotonic Diffusivity Behavior**:
    The non-monotonic behavior of diffusivity is interpreted in the context of the interplay between rectification effects at low densities and caging effects at high densities. This interpretation
