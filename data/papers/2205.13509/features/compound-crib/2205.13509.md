the swimmer, as it continues to exhibit enhanced diffusivity due to the perturbation of its orbits. However, as the density increases, the swimmer's ability to navigate through the environment becomes increasingly hindered, leading to a more complex interplay between the noise and the obstacle density.

### Chiral Swimmers

Chiral swimmers, modeled as active Brownian particles or those exhibiting run-and-tumble dynamics, are characterized by their ability to move in circular trajectories, particularly when near surfaces. This behavior is a result of hydrodynamic interactions, which are crucial for understanding their transport dynamics in heterogeneous environments. The decision to focus on chiral swimmers stems from their relevance in biological systems (e.g., bacteria like E. coli) and their potential applications in nanotechnology.

### Disorder Types

The researchers distinguish between two types of disorder: dynamic noise and quenched noise. 

1. **Dynamic Noise**: This type of noise affects the swimmer's reorientation, modeled as rotational Brownian diffusion. The rationale for including dynamic noise is to simulate the inherent variability in the motion of real microswimmers, which can be influenced by factors such as flagellar motion and environmental perturbations. By examining the effects of dynamic noise, the researchers can better understand how fluctuations in swimmer orientation impact overall transport dynamics.

2. **Quenched Noise**: This includes positional disorder of obstacles and size polydispersity. The inclusion of quenched noise is justified by the fact that real-world environments are often heterogeneous, with obstacles that vary in size and position. By modeling these variations, the researchers can explore how fixed disorder in the environment influences the swimmer's motion, providing insights into the robustness of transport mechanisms in disordered media.

### Effective Diffusion Coefficient (D)

The effective diffusion coefficient \(D\) is a critical parameter that quantifies the transport properties of the swimmer. It is derived from the mean square displacement (MSD) of the swimmer's trajectory, which is a standard approach in statistical mechanics to characterize diffusion. The researchers chose this method because it allows for a clear and quantitative assessment of how the swimmer's motion is affected by both the obstacle density and the types of noise present. The relationship \(MSD(t) \sim 4Dt\) indicates that at long times, the swimmer's motion can be approximated as diffusive, which is a fundamental assumption in the study of active matter.

### Obstacle Density (ρ)

The definition of obstacle density \(ρ\) as the percentage of surface area covered by obstacles is crucial for understanding the impact of environmental structure on swimmer dynamics. By varying \(ρ\), the researchers can systematically investigate how increasing obstacle density alters the swimmer's transport properties. This approach allows for the identification of critical densities where the swimmer's behavior transitions from enhanced diffusion to hindered transport, providing insights into optimal conditions for active transport in disordered environments.

### Weeks-Chandler-Anderson Potential

The use of the Weeks-Chandler-Anderson (WCA) potential to model interactions between swimmers and obstacles is justified by its ability to capture the essential features of repulsive interactions while avoiding unphysical overlaps. The WCA potential is a truncated Lennard-Jones potential that effectively describes the short-range repulsion and long-range attraction typical in colloidal systems. This choice allows the researchers to simulate realistic interactions that swimmers might encounter in biological or engineered environments.

### Trajectory Equations

The trajectory equations governing the swimmer's motion incorporate both translational and rotational dynamics, reflecting the complexity of chiral motion. The inclusion of forces \(F_x\) and \(F_y\) derived from the potential ensures that the swimmer's motion is influenced by its interactions with obstacles. The stochastic term \(2D_R \xi_\phi\) introduces rotational noise, allowing for a more realistic representation of swimmer dynamics. This comprehensive modeling approach enables the researchers to capture the nuanced effects of disorder on swimmer trajectories.

### Mean Square Displacement (MSD)

The MSD is a fundamental metric for characterizing the transport properties of the swimmer. By averaging over multiple trajectories, the researchers can obtain a robust estimate of the effective diffusion coefficient \(D\). The choice to analyze the MSD at long times ensures that transient effects are minimized, allowing for a clearer understanding of the steady-state behavior of the swimmer in the presence of obstacles and noise.

### Non-monotonic Diffusivity

The observation of non-monotonic diffusivity with increasing obstacle density is a key finding of the study. At low densities, the rectification of chiral motion enhances transport, while at high densities, caging effects dominate, leading to reduced diffusivity. This behavior highlights the complex interplay between swimmer dynamics and environmental structure, emphasizing the importance of optimizing obstacle arrangements for enhanced transport in practical applications.

### Ideal Chiral Swimmer

The concept of the ideal chiral swimmer serves as a reference point for understanding the effects of disorder and noise. By comparing the behavior of the ideal swimmer in homogeneous environments to that in heterogeneous environments, the researchers can isolate the effects of obstacles and noise on transport dynamics. This comparative approach is essential for drawing meaningful conclusions
