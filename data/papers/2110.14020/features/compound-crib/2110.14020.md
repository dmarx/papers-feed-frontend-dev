The research on Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) and its associated challenges, particularly extrapolation error and the tandem effect, is critical for advancing the field, especially in practical applications like robotics and healthcare. Below is a detailed technical explanation of the researchers' decisions regarding these topics:

### Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL)

**Justification for Focus on Offline RL:**
- **Practical Relevance:** Offline RL allows learning from existing datasets without the need for costly and potentially dangerous interactions with the environment. This is particularly important in fields like healthcare, where data is often collected from past patient interactions, and in robotics, where physical trials can be expensive and risky.
- **Stationarity of Data:** The stationary nature of offline datasets simplifies the convergence analysis of learning algorithms, making it easier to study learning dynamics without the confounding effects of changing data distributions that occur in online settings.

### Extrapolation Error

**Rationale for Addressing Extrapolation Error:**
- **Impact on Policy Performance:** Extrapolation error arises when the value of under-represented state-action pairs is over-estimated, leading to suboptimal policies. This is a significant concern in offline RL, where the agent cannot explore to correct these errors.
- **Bootstrapping Amplification:** The researchers highlight that bootstrapping can exacerbate extrapolation errors, as poorly estimated values can propagate through the learning process, leading to increasingly inaccurate value estimates.

### Corrective Feedback Loop

**Importance of the Feedback Loop:**
- **Self-Correction in Online RL:** In online RL, agents can correct over-estimations through exploration (trying new actions) and under-estimations through exploitation (choosing known good actions). This self-correcting mechanism is absent in offline settings, making it crucial to develop alternative strategies to mitigate errors.

### Policy Constraints

**Strategies to Mitigate Extrapolation Error:**
- **Policy Update Constraints:** By constraining policy updates to remain close to the state-action distribution of the dataset, the researchers aim to prevent the agent from making overly optimistic estimates based on limited data.
- **Pessimism Bias:** Introducing a pessimistic bias helps counteract the tendency to over-estimate the value of under-represented actions, thereby improving the robustness of the learned policy.
- **Diverse Datasets:** Utilizing large and diverse datasets enhances state space coverage, reducing the likelihood of encountering under-represented state-action pairs and thus minimizing extrapolation errors.

### Tandem Learning Paradigm

**Rationale for the Tandem Learning Setup:**
- **Decoupling Learning Dynamics:** The tandem learning paradigm allows for a clear analysis of the difficulties faced by passive learners by pairing an active agent (which interacts with the environment) with a passive agent (which learns from the active agent's data). This setup isolates the learning dynamics from the data generation process, facilitating a more focused study of the challenges in offline learning.

### Tandem Effect

**Understanding the Tandem Effect:**
- **Observation of Learning Discrepancies:** The researchers observe that passive learners often fail to learn effectively from data that is sufficient for active learners, highlighting the limitations of passive learning in RL.
- **Empirical Findings:** The divergence in value estimates between active and passive agents for less frequent actions underscores the challenges posed by extrapolation errors and the inadequacies of passive learning.

### Contributing Factors to the Tandem Effect

**Analysis of Key Factors:**
- **Bootstrapping (B):** The amplification of mis-estimation through bootstrapping is a critical factor, as it can lead to a cascading effect of errors in value estimates.
- **Data Distribution (D):** Insufficient coverage of actions in the dataset can lead to mis-estimation, particularly for actions that are rarely encountered.
- **Function Approximation (F):** Non-linear function approximators may struggle with extrapolation, leading to erroneous value estimates for underrepresented actions.

### Empirical Findings

**Insights from Experiments:**
- **Value Correlation:** The similarity in values for common actions between active and passive agents, contrasted with significant divergence for less frequent actions, illustrates the challenges of passive learning.
- **Over-Estimation Growth:** The tendency for passive agents to over-estimate state-action values during training highlights the need for strategies to mitigate this issue.

### Tandem DQN Implementation

**Implementation Details:**
- **Training Protocol:** The use of a structured training protocol with a defined budget and evaluation steps allows for a systematic comparison of active and passive agents, providing insights into their learning dynamics.
- **Environment Diversity:** Testing across various environments (e.g., Atari games) ensures that findings are robust and applicable to different scenarios.

### Dataset Characteristics

**Impact of Dataset Properties:**
- **Size and Diversity:** The researchers emphasize the importance of dataset characteristics, such as size and diversity, in enhancing the success of offline learning. A well-structured dataset can significantly improve the learning outcomes of passive agents.
- **Self-Generated Data:** The potential benefits of incorporating small amounts of self-generated data into the training process are
