  "abstract": "In this work, we investigate a challenging problem, which has been considered\nto be an important criterion in designing codewords for DNA computing purposes,\nnamely secondary structure avoidance in single-stranded DNA molecules. In\nshort, secondary structure refers to the tendency of a single-stranded DNA\nsequence to fold back upon itself, thus becoming inactive in the computation\nprocess. While some design criteria that reduces the possibility of secondary\nstructure formation has been proposed by Milenkovic and Kashyap (2006), the\nmain contribution of this work is to provide an explicit construction of DNA\ncodes that completely avoid secondary structure of arbitrary stem length.\nFormally, given codeword length n and arbitrary integer m>=2, we provide\nefficient methods to construct DNA codes of length n that avoid secondary\nstructure of any stem length more than or equal to m. Particularly, when m = 3,\nour constructions yield a family of DNA codes of rate 1.3031 bits/nt, while the\nhighest rate found in the prior art was 1.1609 bits/nt. In addition, for\nm>=3log n + 4, we provide an efficient encoder that incurs only one redundant\nsymbol.",
