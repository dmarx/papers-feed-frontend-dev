  "abstract": "Historically, scientific discovery has been a lengthy and costly process,\ndemanding substantial time and resources from initial conception to final\nresults. To accelerate scientific discovery, reduce research costs, and improve\nresearch quality, we introduce Agent Laboratory, an autonomous LLM-based\nframework capable of completing the entire research process. This framework\naccepts a human-provided research idea and progresses through three\nstages--literature review, experimentation, and report writing to produce\ncomprehensive research outputs, including a code repository and a research\nreport, while enabling users to provide feedback and guidance at each stage. We\ndeploy Agent Laboratory with various state-of-the-art LLMs and invite multiple\nresearchers to assess its quality by participating in a survey, providing human\nfeedback to guide the research process, and then evaluate the final paper. We\nfound that: (1) Agent Laboratory driven by o1-preview generates the best\nresearch outcomes; (2) The generated machine learning code is able to achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods; (3) Human\ninvolvement, providing feedback at each stage, significantly improves the\noverall quality of research; (4) Agent Laboratory significantly reduces\nresearch expenses, achieving an 84% decrease compared to previous autonomous\nresearch methods. We hope Agent Laboratory enables researchers to allocate more\neffort toward creative ideation rather than low-level coding and writing,\nultimately accelerating scientific discovery.",
