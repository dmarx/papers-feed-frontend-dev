- **Trans-Planckian Problem (TPP)**: Momentum states redshift due to cosmic expansion, potentially bringing trans-Planckian modes into observable scales, impacting predictions for the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).

- **Effective Field Theory (EFT)**: Tools to understand decoupling in physical systems with multiple energy scales. Validity is limited by a maximum energy scale where the expansion in powers of E/M breaks down.

- **Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC)**: Proposes that laws of physics must prevent trans-Planckian modes from becoming relevant at low energies, particularly during inflation, leading to constraints on inflationary models.

- **Decoupling Principle**: Short-distance physics (high energy) does not significantly affect long-distance physics (low energy), allowing for effective predictions in low-energy regimes.

- **Non-adiabatic Evolution**: A situation where the energy scale ratio E(t)/M(t) becomes large over time, potentially leading to breakdowns in EFT methods.

- **Cosmological Context**: The role of time-dependent background fields complicates the application of EFTs, as they introduce new expected ways to exit the domain of validity of EFTs.

- **EFT Breakdown**: EFTs are expected to fail when the hierarchy of scales is not large, particularly in nonrenormalizable theories like General Relativity (GR).

- **Example Systems**: 
  - **Slowly Rolling Scalar Fields**: Illustrates how similar issues arise in simpler non-gravitational contexts.
  - **Landau Levels**: Spacing between energy levels in charged particles under slowly varying magnetic fields serves as an analogy for understanding EFT breakdown.

- **UV Completions**: Theories that extend EFTs to high energies, often considered in the context of string theory, which may not always yield sensible low-energy EFTs.

- **Hubble Scale**: During inflation, the Hubble scale \( H(t) \) is approximately constant, influencing the dynamics of modes relevant to the CMB.

- **Sample Trans-Planckian Bound**: For an inflationary scenario with scale factor \( a(t) \), the physical momentum \( K(t) = k/a(t) \) must be considered, particularly for modes that leave and re-enter the Hubble scale.

- **Figure 1 Overview**: 
  - Left Panel: Illustrates adiabatic time evolution of energy states, showing how EFT methods can initially be valid but may fail as energy scales approach a cutoff.
  - Right Panel: Depicts the trans-Planckian scenario where states evolve below a fixed cutoff without UV and IR levels becoming close, indicating potential EFT robustness.

- **Implications for Late-time Cosmology**: The descent of modes due to universal expansion does not necessarily threaten the consistency of late-time cosmological predictions if EFT methods are appropriately applied.
