## Technical Explanations and Justifications for Apollo's Design Decisions

### Model Overview
Apollo is designed as a generative model for high-sampling-rate audio restoration, leveraging a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework. The rationale behind using a GAN is its ability to generate high-quality outputs by learning from the distribution of real data. In audio restoration, the goal is to predict undistorted audio from degraded inputs, which is a complex task due to the intricate nature of audio signals and the various types of distortions they can undergo. The GAN framework allows Apollo to balance the perceptual quality of the restored audio with the fidelity of the reconstruction, making it suitable for applications requiring high audio quality.

### Key Modules
1. **Frequency Band Split Module**:
   - **Justification**: Audio signals are inherently multi-dimensional, with different frequency bands contributing differently to the overall sound. By splitting the audio spectrogram into K sub-band spectrograms, Apollo can focus on the unique characteristics of each frequency band. This approach helps in preserving audio content, especially in the mid and high-frequency ranges where degradation is most pronounced.
   - **Gain-Shape Representation**: The gain-shape representation allows the model to decouple the content and energy of the audio signal, which is crucial for effective restoration. This representation captures both the amplitude and phase information, enabling the model to learn more nuanced mappings for reconstruction.

2. **Band-Sequence Modeling Module**:
   - **Architecture Choice**: The use of stacked Roformer and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) architectures is motivated by the need to capture both temporal and frequency dependencies in the audio signal. Roformer, which incorporates attention mechanisms, allows for capturing long-range dependencies across frequency bands, while TCNs are effective for modeling temporal sequences.
   - **Joint Modeling**: By jointly modeling temporal and sub-band features, Apollo can better understand the relationships between different frequency bands over time, leading to more coherent audio restoration.

3. **Band-Reconstruction Module**:
   - **Inverse STFT**: The use of inverse Short-Time Fourier Transform (iSTFT) to convert the output back into a waveform is a standard practice in audio processing. This method ensures that the reconstructed audio maintains the time-frequency characteristics of the original signal, facilitating a more accurate restoration.

### Mathematical Representations
- **Gain-Shape Representation**: The mathematical formulation for gain-shape representation allows for a comprehensive understanding of the audio signal's characteristics. By normalizing the real and imaginary parts and including logarithmic scaling, the model can effectively learn to reconstruct audio with varying energy levels.
- **L2-Norm Calculation**: The L2-norm is a standard measure for quantifying the magnitude of complex numbers, which is essential for understanding the energy distribution across frequency bands.

### Training Objective
- **Discriminator Loss (Least Squares GAN)**: The choice of LSGAN loss is based on its stability and effectiveness in training GANs. It helps in reducing the likelihood of mode collapse, a common issue in GAN training, by providing a smoother gradient for the generator.
- **Generator Loss**: The composite loss function, which includes reconstruction loss, feature matching loss, and adversarial loss, ensures that the model not only focuses on accurately reconstructing the audio but also on maintaining perceptual quality. The multi-resolution approach in the reconstruction loss allows the model to capture both fine and coarse details, which is critical for high-quality audio restoration.

### Performance Evaluation
- **Datasets**: The use of diverse datasets like MUSDB18-HQ and MoisesDB allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance across different music genres and bit rates. This diversity is crucial for ensuring that the model generalizes well to various audio restoration scenarios.
- **Comparison with SR-GAN**: By outperforming existing models like SR-GAN, Apollo demonstrates its effectiveness in handling complex audio restoration tasks, particularly in scenarios with multiple overlapping audio sources.

### Hyperparameters
- **STFT Parameters**: The choice of a 20 ms window length and 10 ms hop size is a balance between time resolution and frequency resolution, which is essential for capturing the dynamics of audio signals.
- **Frequency Segmentation**: A bandwidth of 160 Hz for frequency segmentation allows for a detailed analysis of the audio signal while maintaining computational efficiency.
- **Stacking Depth**: A stacking depth of B = 6 for the Band Sequence modeling module provides sufficient capacity for the model to learn complex relationships without overfitting.

### Efficiency
- **Real-Time Applications**: Apollo's design prioritizes computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time audio restoration applications. The use of causal convolution and causal Roformer enables streaming processing, which is essential for applications like live audio restoration.

### Source Code Availability
- The availability of Apollo's source code on GitHub promotes transparency and encourages further research and development in the field of audio restoration, allowing other researchers to build upon the work.

In summary, the design decisions made in Apollo are grounded in a deep understanding of
