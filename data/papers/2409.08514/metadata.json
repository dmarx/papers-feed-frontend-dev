  "title": "Apollo: Band-sequence Modeling for High-Quality Audio Restoration",
  "authors": "Kai Li, Yi Luo",
  "abstract": "Audio restoration has become increasingly significant in modern society, not\nonly due to the demand for high-quality auditory experiences enabled by\nadvanced playback devices, but also because the growing capabilities of\ngenerative audio models necessitate high-fidelity audio. Typically, audio\nrestoration is defined as a task of predicting undistorted audio from damaged\ninput, often trained using a GAN framework to balance perception and\ndistortion. Since audio degradation is primarily concentrated in mid- and\nhigh-frequency ranges, especially due to codecs, a key challenge lies in\ndesigning a generator capable of preserving low-frequency information while\naccurately reconstructing high-quality mid- and high-frequency content.\nInspired by recent advancements in high-sample-rate music separation, speech\nenhancement, and audio codec models, we propose Apollo, a generative model\ndesigned for high-sample-rate audio restoration. Apollo employs an explicit\nfrequency band split module to model the relationships between different\nfrequency bands, allowing for more coherent and higher-quality restored audio.\nEvaluated on the MUSDB18-HQ and MoisesDB datasets, Apollo consistently\noutperforms existing SR-GAN models across various bit rates and music genres,\nparticularly excelling in complex scenarios involving mixtures of multiple\ninstruments and vocals. Apollo significantly improves music restoration quality\nwhile maintaining computational efficiency. The source code for Apollo is\npublicly available at https://github.com/JusperLee/Apollo.",
