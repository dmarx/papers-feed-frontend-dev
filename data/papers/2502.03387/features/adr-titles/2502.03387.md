- Decision to challenge conventional wisdom on data requirements for reasoning tasks
- Choice to focus on mathematical reasoning as a primary domain for experiments
- Adoption of the Less-Is-More Reasoning Hypothesis (LIMO Hypothesis)
- Selection of 817 curated training samples for model training
- Decision to compare LIMO with existing models like LIMA and RL Scaling
- Strategy for leveraging pre-trained knowledge in foundation models
- Implementation of inference-time computation scaling techniques
- Design of cognitive templates for effective reasoning elicitation
- Approach to measuring out-of-distribution generalization
- Decision to release LIMO as an open-source suite for reproducibility
- Choice of benchmarks (AIME and MATH) for evaluating model performance
- Methodology for systematic empirical evidence collection
- Decision to emphasize the importance of minimal but high-quality training samples
- Strategy for addressing the computational costs associated with traditional training methods
- Decision to explore the implications of the LIMO findings for future AI research
- Choice to document critical factors for effective reasoning elicitation in the project.
