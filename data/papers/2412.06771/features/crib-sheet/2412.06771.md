- **Problem Statement**: User prompts for T2I generation are often underspecified, leading to sub-optimal image outputs.
  
- **Proactive T2I Agents**: Introduce agents that actively ask clarification questions and present a belief graph to visualize user intent.

- **Belief Graph**: A graph-based symbolic representation of the agent's understanding, including:
  - **Entities**: Possible objects in the image (e.g., rabbit).
  - **Attributes**: Characteristics of entities (e.g., color of the rabbit).
  - **Relations**: Spatial or contextual relationships between entities.

- **Question-asking Strategy**: Agents identify the most uncertain attribute and generate questions (e.g., "What is the color of the rabbit?") to clarify user intent.

- **User Interaction**: Users can edit the belief graph directly, allowing for real-time adjustments to the agent's understanding.

- **Image Generation Process**:
  1. User provides an initial prompt.
  2. Agent asks clarifying questions based on the belief graph.
  3. User answers or edits the graph.
  4. Agent updates the prompt and generates an image using a T2I model.

- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - **VQAScore**: Measures alignment between generated images and user prompts, showing at least 2x improvement with proactive agents compared to single-turn systems.
  - **DesignBench**: A benchmark created for evaluating T2I agents, featuring diverse image styles and complex prompts.

- **Human Study Findings**:
  - 90% of participants found proactive clarifications helpful.
  - 85% found belief graphs beneficial.
  - 80% preferred images generated by proactive agents over traditional methods.

- **Contributions**:
  - First explainable and controllable belief graph for T2I.
  - Novel design for T2I agents that ask questions and present belief graphs.
  - New automatic evaluation pipeline for assessing T2I agent performance.
  - Introduction of DesignBench as a benchmark for T2I agents.

- **Related Work**: Discusses challenges in AI communication, active learning, and human-computer interaction, emphasizing the need for agents to actively seek information to reduce uncertainty.

- **Future Directions**: Potential integration of consistency improvement methods and further enhancements to the modular structure of the agent prototypes.
