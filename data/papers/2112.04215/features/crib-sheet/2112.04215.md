- **Key Concept**: Continual Self-Supervised Learning (CSSL) integrates self-supervised learning (SSL) with continual learning (CL) to address catastrophic forgetting in sequential data scenarios.
  
- **Framework**: CaSSLe (Continual Self-Supervised Learning) framework enables SSL models to learn continually by predicting past representations using a predictor network.

- **Loss Function**: The SSL loss function \( L_{SSL}(z_A, z_B) \) is adapted into a distillation loss by training the model to predict past representations, enhancing retention of learned knowledge.

- **Training Objective**: The CSSL objective is defined as:
  \[
  \arg\min_\theta \sum_{t=1}^{T} E_{x \sim D_t} [L_{SSL}(z_A, z_B)]
  \]
  where \( z_A \) and \( z_B \) are representations from augmented views of input data.

- **Evaluation Protocol**: After each task, a linear classifier is trained on the backbone \( f_b \) to evaluate performance, compatible with standard CL metrics.

- **CSSL Settings**:
  - **Class-incremental**: Tasks consist of disjoint class sets \( Y_t \).
  - **Data-incremental**: Tasks consist of disjoint image sets \( D_t \) without class constraints.
  - **Domain-incremental**: Tasks consist of images from different domains but the same class set.

- **Empirical Results**: CaSSLe significantly outperforms existing CSSL baselines and supervised methods in various settings, particularly in class-incremental scenarios.

- **Compatibility**: CaSSLe is compatible with several state-of-the-art SSL methods, requiring minimal hyperparameter tuning.

- **Computational Efficiency**: The proposed method is designed to be computationally efficient, addressing the high resource demands of traditional SSL training.

- **Visual Representation Quality**: The framework enhances the quality of learned representations, making them more robust to sequential learning challenges.

- **Key Findings**: SSL methods can approach or outperform supervised learning in class-incremental settings, highlighting their potential in continual learning scenarios.
