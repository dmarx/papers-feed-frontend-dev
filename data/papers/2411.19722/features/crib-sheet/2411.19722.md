- **Model Overview**: JetFormer is an autoregressive decoder-only transformer designed for joint generative modeling of text and raw images, trained end-to-end without pretrained components.

- **Key Components**:
  - **Normalizing Flow**: Utilizes a normalizing flow model to create a soft-token representation of images, allowing for lossless encoding and decoding.
  - **Soft Tokens**: Images are represented as continuous soft tokens, enabling effective autoregressive modeling.

- **Training Objective**: The model maximizes the log-likelihood of raw data, expressed as:
  \[
  L(x) = \log p(f(x)) + \log \det \frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x}^T
  \]
  where \( f(x) \) produces soft tokens and \( p(z) \) is modeled autoregressively.

- **Image Dequantization**: Incorporates uniform noise \( u \) to ensure optimization of a lower bound on discrete image log-likelihood:
  \[
  x = I + u, \quad u \sim U[0, 1]
  \]

- **Model Enhancements**:
  - **Noise Curriculum**: Introduces Gaussian noise during training, gradually reducing it to focus on high-level information.
  - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Explores PCA and exclusion of redundant dimensions to improve computational efficiency and model quality.

- **Performance**: JetFormer achieves competitive text-to-image generation quality compared to VQVAE and VAE-based models, demonstrating robust image understanding capabilities.

- **Applications**: Effective for both text-to-image generation and vision-language understanding tasks, showcasing scalability to web-scale multimodal data.

- **Related Work**: Contrasts with existing models that rely on pretrained VQ-VAEs, highlighting JetFormerâ€™s ability to learn from raw data without lossy encoders.

- **Training Methodology**: Employs gradient-based optimization for both the normalizing flow and autoregressive model, ensuring end-to-end learning.

- **Key Insight**: The combination of soft tokens and normalizing flows allows for high-fidelity image generation while maintaining the flexibility of a unified multimodal model.
