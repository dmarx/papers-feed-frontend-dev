The decisions made by researchers in adopting a kernel perspective for regularizing deep neural networks, as outlined in the provided abstract and introduction, are grounded in a combination of theoretical insights, practical considerations, and empirical observations. Below is a detailed technical explanation and rationale for each of the specified decisions:

### 1. Decision to Adopt a Kernel Perspective for Regularizing Deep Neural Networks
The kernel perspective allows researchers to leverage the mathematical framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) to analyze and regularize deep neural networks (DNNs). This perspective is beneficial because it provides a structured way to understand the function space in which DNNs operate. By viewing DNNs as elements of an RKHS, researchers can utilize properties of kernels, such as smoothness and continuity, to derive regularization techniques that control model complexity and improve generalization, especially in scenarios with limited data.

### 2. Choice of Using RKHS Norms for Regularization
RKHS norms serve as natural regularization functions that quantify the complexity of functions represented by DNNs. The RKHS norm can be interpreted as a measure of the model's capacity to fit the training data while maintaining smoothness. This is particularly important in preventing overfitting, as it encourages models to generalize better to unseen data. The RKHS norm also acts as a Lipschitz constant, providing a direct mechanism to control the model's sensitivity to input perturbations, which is crucial for adversarial robustness.

### 3. Decision to Approximate RKHS Norms with Upper and Lower Bounds
Since the RKHS norm is often intractable to compute directly in the context of DNNs, researchers opted to derive upper and lower bounds as practical approximations. This approach allows for the development of regularization strategies that can be efficiently implemented during training. By using bounds, researchers can create penalties that are computationally feasible while still capturing the essential characteristics of the RKHS norm, thus enabling effective regularization without the need for exact calculations.

### 4. Selection of Specific Regularization Principles to Unify under the RKHS Framework
The unification of various regularization principles under the RKHS framework is motivated by the desire to provide a coherent theoretical foundation for existing methods. By showing that techniques such as spectral norm regularization, gradient penalties, and adversarial training can be derived from the RKHS perspective, researchers can offer a more comprehensive understanding of how these methods relate to one another. This unification also facilitates the development of new regularization strategies that leverage insights from multiple approaches.

### 5. Decision to Focus on Adversarial Robustness in the Context of Regularization
Adversarial robustness is a critical concern in deep learning, as small perturbations can lead to significant degradation in model performance. By focusing on adversarial robustness within the regularization framework, researchers aim to enhance the stability of DNNs against adversarial attacks. The RKHS perspective provides a natural way to incorporate robustness into the training process, as controlling the RKHS norm directly influences the model's sensitivity to input variations.

### 6. Choice of Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as the Primary Model
CNNs are particularly well-suited for tasks involving spatial data, such as images, due to their hierarchical structure and ability to capture local patterns. The decision to use CNNs aligns with the goal of applying the RKHS perspective to practical deep learning scenarios. Additionally, the existing literature on CNNs and their relationship with kernels provides a solid foundation for exploring the RKHS framework, making it a logical choice for the researchers.

### 7. Decision to Leverage Smooth Approximations of ReLU Activations
ReLU activations are widely used in DNNs due to their simplicity and effectiveness. However, they introduce non-smoothness, which can complicate the analysis within the RKHS framework. By using smooth approximations of ReLU, researchers can maintain the benefits of ReLU while ensuring that the resulting functions are amenable to analysis in the RKHS context. This decision enhances the theoretical tractability of the model while preserving its practical performance.

### 8. Choice of Optimization Strategies for Training with Small Datasets
When working with small datasets, overfitting is a significant risk. The choice of optimization strategies that incorporate regularization techniques derived from the RKHS perspective is aimed at mitigating this risk. By employing penalties that control model complexity, researchers can improve generalization and robustness, making the training process more effective even with limited data.

### 9. Decision to Explore Hybrid Strategies Combining Upper and Lower Bounds
Hybrid strategies that combine upper and lower bounds on the RKHS norm can provide tighter approximations and more effective regularization. This decision is based on the observation that using both bounds can lead to improved empirical performance, as it allows for a more nuanced control of the model's complexity. By leveraging the strengths of both approaches, researchers can enhance the robustness and generalization capabilities of their models.

### 10. Selection of Specific Penalties Based on Adversarial Perturbations
The use of penalties based on advers
