  "title": "A Kernel Perspective for Regularizing Deep Neural Networks",
  "authors": "Alberto Bietti, Gr\u00e9goire Mialon, Dexiong Chen, Julien Mairal",
  "abstract": "We propose a new point of view for regularizing deep neural networks by using\nthe norm of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Even though this norm\ncannot be computed, it admits upper and lower approximations leading to various\npractical strategies. Specifically, this perspective (i) provides a common\numbrella for many existing regularization principles, including spectral norm\nand gradient penalties, or adversarial training, (ii) leads to new effective\nregularization penalties, and (iii) suggests hybrid strategies combining lower\nand upper bounds to get better approximations of the RKHS norm. We\nexperimentally show this approach to be effective when learning on small\ndatasets, or to obtain adversarially robust models.",
