- **Projective Composition Definition**: A formal definition of composition that captures the desired outcome of combining different distributions, focusing on the aspects to be composed (Definition 4.1).

- **Linear Score Combination**: The method of composing diffusion models by linearly combining their scores, defined as:
  \[
  \nabla_x \log p(x) = \nabla_x \log p_{\text{dog}}(x) + \nabla_x \log p_{\text{oil}}(x) - \nabla_x \log p_u(x)
  \]
  This defines a "product composition": \( p(x) \propto \frac{p_{\text{dog}}(x) p_{\text{oil}}(x)}{p_u(x)} \).

- **Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Generalization**: The ability of the compositional method to generate samples that are OOD with respect to each individual model, even if none of the models can generate OOD samples on their own.

- **Length-Generalization**: The capacity to compose an arbitrary number of concepts, exemplified by generating images with multiple objects in a scene (e.g., CLEVR experiment).

- **Factorized Conditionals**: A formal criterion (Definition 5.2) that describes independence along both distributions and coordinates, which is necessary for achieving projective composition through linear score combination.

- **Conditions for Success**: The paper identifies specific conditions under which projective composition can be achieved, including the requirement that score delta vectors are mutually orthogonal and have disjoint supports.

- **Experiments Overview**:
  - **Experiment (A)**: Successful composition of multiple objects with an empty background.
  - **Experiment (B)**: Failure of composition when using an unconditional distribution as the background.
  - **Experiment (C)**: Partial success with artifacts when composing multiple objects with a background of varying object counts.

- **Theoretical Insights**: The paper discusses how existing empirical observations can be explained through the theoretical framework established, highlighting both successes and failures in composition.

- **Limitations of Prior Definitions**: Critique of the "simple product" and Bayes composition definitions, which fail to adequately describe the outcomes of complex compositional tasks like the CLEVR experiment.

- **Sampling Techniques**: Discussion on the use of standard reverse-diffusion samplers for generating samples from the composite distribution, and the challenges that arise in nonlinear feature spaces.

- **Connection to Prior Work**: The paper situates its findings within the broader context of existing literature on diffusion models and compositional methods, referencing key studies that have explored similar themes.
