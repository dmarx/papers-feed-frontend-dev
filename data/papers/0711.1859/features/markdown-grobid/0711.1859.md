# DOUBLES FOR MONOIDAL CATEGORIES

## Abstract

## 

In a recent paper, Daisuke Tambara defined two-sided actions on an endomodule (= endodistributor) of a monoidal V -category A . When A is autonomous (= rigid = compact), he showed that the V -category (that we call Tamb(A )) of so-equipped endomodules (that we call Tambara modules) is equivalent to the monoidal centre Z[A , V ] of the convolution monoidal Vcategory [A , V ]. Our paper extends these ideas somewhat. For general A , we construct a promonoidal V -category DA (which we suggest should be called the double of A ) with an equivalence [DA , V ] ≃ Tamb(A ). When A is closed, we define strong (respectively, left strong) Tambara modules and show that these constitute a V -category Tambs(A ) (respectively, Tamb ls (A )) which is equivalent to the centre (respectively, lax centre) of [A , V ]. We construct localizations DsA and D ls A of DA such that there are equivalences Tambs(A ) ≃ [DsA , V ] and Tamb ls (A ) ≃ [D ls A , V ]. When A is autonomous, every Tambara module is strong; this implies an equivalence

## Introduction

For V -categories A and B, a module T : A / / B (also called "bimodule", "profunctor", and "distributor") is a V -functor T : B op ⊗ A / / V . For a monoidal V -category A , Tambara [[Tam06]](#b8) defined two-sided actions α of A on an endomodule T : A / / A . When A is autonomous (also called "rigid" or "compact") he showed that the V -category Tamb(A ) of Tambara modules (T, α) is equivalent to the monoidal centre Z[A , V ] of the convolution monoidal V -category [A , V ].

Our paper extends these ideas in four ways:

(1) our base monoidal category V is quite general (as in [[Kel82]](#b4)) not just vector spaces;

(2) our results are mainly for a closed monoidal V -category A , generalizing the autonomous case;

(3) we show the connection with the lax centre as well as the centre; and, (4) we introduce the double DA of a monoidal V -category A and some localizations of it, and relate these to Tambara modules.

Our principal goal is to give conditions under which the centre and lax centre of a V -valued V -functor monoidal V -category is again such. Some results in this direction can be found in [[DS07]](#b2).

For general monoidal A , we construct a promonoidal V -category DA with an equivalence [DA , V ] ≃ Tamb(A ). When A is closed, we define when a Tambara module is (left) strong and show that these constitute a V -category (Tamb ls (A )) Tamb s (A ) which is equivalent to the (lax) centre of [A , V ]. We construct localizations D s A and D ls A of DA such that there are equivalences Tamb s (A ) ≃ [D s A , V ] and Tamb ls (A ) ≃ [D ls A , V ]. When A is autonomous, every Tambara module is strong, which implies an equivalence Z[A , V ] ≃ [DA , V ]. These results should be compared with those of [[DS07]](#b2) where the lax centre of [A , V ] is shown generally to be a full sub-V -category of a functor V -category [A M , V ] which also becomes an equivalence Z[A , V ] ≃ [A M , V ] when A is autonomous.

As we were completing this paper, Ignacio Lopez Franco sent us his preprint [LF07] which has some results in common with ours. As an example for V -modules of his general constructions on pseudomonoids, he is also led to what we call the double monad.

## Centres and convolution

We work with categories enriched in a base monoidal category V as used by Kelly [[Kel82]](#b4). It is symmetric, closed, complete and cocomplete.

Let A denote a closed monoidal V -category. We denote the tensor product by A ⊗ B and the unit by I in the hope that this will cause no confusion with the same symbols used for the base V itself. We have V -natural isomorphisms

$A (A, B C) ∼ = A (A ⊗ B, C) ∼ = A (B, C A )$defined by evaluation and coevaluation morphisms

$e l : B C ⊗ B / / C, d l : A / / B (A ⊗ B), e r : A ⊗ C A / / C, d r : B / / (A ⊗ B) A .$Consequently, there are canonical isomorphisms

$A⊗B C ∼ = A ( B C), C A⊗B ∼ = (C A ) B , ( B C) A ∼ = B (C A ) and I C ∼ = C ∼ = C I$which we write as if they were identifications just as we do with the associativity and unit isomorphisms. We also write B C A for B (C A ). The Day convolution monoidal structure [[Day70]](#b0) on the V -category [A , V ] of V -functors from A to V consists of the tensor product F * G and unit J defined by

$(F * G)A = U,V A (U ⊗ V, A) ⊗ F U ⊗ GV ∼ = V F ( V A) ⊗ GV ∼ = U F U ⊗ G(A U ) and JA = A (I, A).$In particular,

$(F * A (A, -))B ∼ = F ( A B) and (A (A, -) * G)B ∼ = G(B A ).$The centre of a monoidal category was defined in [[JS91]](#b3) and the lax centre was defined, for example, in [[DPS07]](#b1). Since the representables are dense in [A , V ], an object of the lax centre

$Z l [A , V ] of [A , V ] is a pair (F, θ) consisting of F ∈ [A , V ] and a V -natural family θ of morphisms θ A,B : F ( A B) / / F (B A )$such that the diagrams

$F ( A⊗B C) F (C A⊗B ) θA⊗B,C / / F ( A ( B C)) = F ( B C A ) θ A, B C " " E E E E E E E E E F ((C A ) B ) θ B,$C A < < y y y y y y y y y = O O and F ( I A) F (A I ) θI,A / / F A = ? ? ? ? ? ? =

$? ? commute. The hom object Z l [A , V ]((F, θ), (G, φ)) is defined to be the equalizer of two obvious morphisms out of [A , V ](F, G). The centre Z[A , V ] of [A , V ] is the full sub-V -category of Z l [A , V$] consisting of those objects (F, θ) with θ invertible.

## Tambara modules

Let A denote a monoidal V -category. We do not need A to be closed for the definition of Tambara module although we will require this restriction again later.

A left Tambara module on A is a V -functor T : A op ⊗ A / / V together with a family of morphisms

$α l (A, X, Y ) : T (X, Y ) / / T (A ⊗ X, A ⊗ Y )$which are V -natural in each of the objects A, X and Y , satisfying the two equations α l (I, X, Y ) = 1 T (X,Y ) and

$T (X, Y ) T (A ⊗ A ′ ⊗ X, A ⊗ A ′ ⊗ Y ). α l (A⊗A ′ ,X,Y ) $ $ I I I I I I I I I I I I T (A ′ ⊗ X, A ′ ⊗ Y ) α l (A ′ ,X,Y ) / / α l (A,A ′ ⊗X,A ′ ⊗Y ) z z u u u u u u u u u u u u$Similarly, a right Tambara module on A is a V -functor T : A op ⊗ A / / V together with a family of morphisms

$α r (B, X, Y ) : T (X, Y ) / / T (X ⊗ B, Y ⊗ B)$which are V -natural in each of the objects B, X and Y , satisfying the two equations α r (I, X, Y ) = 1 T (X,Y ) and z z u u u u u u u u u u u u A Tambara module(T, α) on A is a V -functor T : A op ⊗ A / / V together with both left and right Tambara module structures satisfying the "bimodule" compatibility condition

$T (X, Y ) T (X ⊗ B ⊗ B ′ , Y ⊗ B ⊗ B ′ ).$$T (X, Y ) T (A ⊗ X, A ⊗ Y ) α l (A,X,Y ) / / T (A ⊗ X ⊗ B, A ⊗ Y ⊗ B). αr (B,A⊗X,A⊗Y ) T (X ⊗ B, Y ⊗ B) αr(B,X,Y ) α l (A,X⊗B,Y ⊗B) / /$The morphism defined to be the diagonal of the last square is denoted by

$α(A, B, X, Y ) : T (X, Y ) / / T (A ⊗ X ⊗ B, A ⊗ Y ⊗ B)$and we can express a Tambara module structure purely in terms of this, however, we need to refer to the left and right structures below.

Proposition 3.1. Suppose A is a monoidal V -category and T :

$A op ⊗ A / / V is a V -functor. (a) If A is right closed, there is a bijection between V -natural families of mor- phisms α l (A, X, Y ) : T (X, Y ) / / T (A ⊗ X, A ⊗ Y )$and V -natural families of morphisms

$β l (A, X, Y ) : T (X, Y A ) / / T (A ⊗ X, Y ).$(b) Under the bijection of (a), the family α l is a left Tambara structure if and only if the family β l satisfies the two equations

$β l (I, X, Y ) = 1 T (X,Y ) and T (X, Y A⊗A ′ ) T (A ⊗ A ′ ⊗ X, Y ) β l (A⊗A ′ ,X,Y ) / / T (X, (Y A ) A ′ ) = T (A ′ ⊗ X, Y A ). β l (A ′ ,X,Y A ) / / β l (A,A ′ ⊗X,Y ) O O (c) If A is left closed, there is a bijection between V -natural families of morphisms α r (B, X, Y ) : T (X, Y ) / / T (X ⊗ B, Y ⊗ B)$and V -natural families of morphisms

$β r (B, X, Y ) : T (X, B Y ) / / T (X ⊗ B, Y ).$(d) Under the bijection of (c), the family α r is a right Tambara structure if and only if the family β r satisfies the two equations β r (I, X, Y ) = 1 T (X, Y ) and

$T (X, B⊗B ′ Y ) T (X ⊗ B ⊗ B ′ , Y ) βr(B⊗B ′ ,X,Y ) / / T (X, B ( B ′ Y )) = T (X ⊗ B, B ′ Y ). βr(B,X, B ′ Y ) / / βr(B ′ ,X⊗B,Y ) O O (e) If$A is closed, the families α l and α r form a Tambara module structure if and only if the families β l and β r , corresponding under (a) and (c), satisfy the condition

$T (X, B Y A ) T (A ⊗ X, B Y ) β l (A,X, B Y ) / / T (A ⊗ X ⊗ B, Y ). βr(B,A⊗X,Y ) T (X ⊗ B, Y A ) βr(B,X,Y A ) β l (A,X⊗B,Y ) / /$Proof. The bijection of (a) is defined by the formulas

$β l (A, X, Y ) = T (X, Y A ) T (A ⊗ X, A ⊗ Y A ) α l (A,X,Y A ) / / T (A ⊗ X, Y ) T (A⊗X,er ) / / and α l (A, X, Y ) = T (X, Y ) T (X, (A ⊗ Y ) A ) T (X,dr) / / T (A ⊗ X, A ⊗ Y ) β l (A,X,A⊗Y ) / / .$That the processes are mutually inverse uses the adjunction identities on the morphisms e and d. The bijection of (c) is obtained dually by reversing the tensor product. Translation of the conditions from the α to the β as required for (b), (d) and (e) is straightforward.

A left (respectively, right) Tambara module T on A will be called strong when the morphisms

$β l (A, X, Y ) : T (X, Y A ) / / T (A ⊗ X, Y ) (respectively, β r (B, X, Y ) : T (X, B Y ) / / T (X ⊗ B, Y ))$corresponding via Proposition 3.1 to the left (respectively, right) Tambara structure, are invertible. A Tambara module is called left (respectively, right ) strong when it is strong as a left (respectively, right) module and strong when it is both left and right strong. In particular, notice that the hom V -functor (= identity module) of A is a strong Tambara module.

Proposition 3.2. Suppose A is a monoidal V -category and T :

$A op ⊗ A / / V is a V -functor. If A is right (left) autonomous then every left (right) Tambara module is strong.$Proof. If A * denotes a right dual for A with unit η : I / / A * ⊗ A then an inverse for β l is defined by the composite

$T (A ⊗ X, Y ) T (A * ⊗ A ⊗ X, A * ⊗ Y ) α l (A * ,A⊗X,Y ) / / T (X, A * ⊗ Y ) T (η,1) / / .$Write LTamb(A ) for the V -category whose objects are left Tambara modules T = (T, α l ) and whose hom LTamb(A )(T, T ′ ) in V is defined to be the intersection over all A, X and Y of the equalizers of the pairs of morphisms:

$[A op ⊗ A , V ](T, T ′ ) V (T (X, Y ), T ′ (A ⊗ X, A ⊗ Y )) V (α l ,1)•pr A⊗X,A⊗Y / / V (1,α l )•pr X,Y / / .$Equivalently, we can define the hom as an intersection of equalizers of pairs of morphisms:

$[A op ⊗ A , V ](T, T ′ ) V (T (X, Y A ), T ′ (A ⊗ X, Y )) V (β l ,1)•pr A⊗X,Y / / V (1,β l )•pr X,Y A / / .$Composition is defined so that we have a V -functor ι : LTamb(A ) / / [A op ⊗ A , V ] which forgets the left module structure on T . In fact, LTamb(A ) becomes a monoidal V -category in such a way that the forgetful V -functor ι becomes strong monoidal. For this, the monoidal structure on [A op ⊗ A , V ] is the usual tensor product (= composition) of endomodules:

$(T ⊗ A T ′ )(X, Y ) = Z T (X, Z) ⊗ T ′ (Z, Y ).$When T and T ′ are left Tambara modules, the left Tambara structure

$(T ⊗ A T ′ )(X, Y ) / / (T ⊗ A T ′ )(A ⊗ X, A ⊗ Y )$on T ⊗ A T ′ is defined by taking its composite with the coprojection copr Z into the above coend to be the composite

$T (X, Z) ⊗ T ′ (Z, Y ) T (A ⊗ X, A ⊗ Z) ⊗ T ′ (A ⊗ Z, A ⊗ Y ) α l ⊗α l / / (T ⊗ A T ′ )(A ⊗ X, A ⊗ Y ) copr A⊗Z / / .$Similarly we obtain monoidal V -categories RTamb(A ) and Tamb(A ) of right Tambara and all Tambara modules on A . We write LTamb s (A ) for the full sub-V -category of LTamb(A ) consisting of the strong left Tambara modules. We write Tamb ls (A ), Tamb rs (A ) and Tamb s (A ) for the full sub-V -categories of Tamb(A ) consisting of the left strong, right strong and strong Tambara modules respectively.

If A is autonomous then Tamb(A ) = Tamb ls (A ) = Tamb rs (A ) = Tamb s (A ) by Proposition 3.2.

## The Cayley functor

Consider a right closed monoidal V -category A . There is a Cayley V -functor

$Υ : [A , V ] / / [A op ⊗ A , V ] defined as follows. To each object F ∈ [A , V ], define Υ(F ) = T F by T F (X, Y ) = F (Y X ). The effect Υ F,G : [A , V ](F, G) / / [A op ⊗ A , V ](T F , T G ) of Υ on homs is defined by taking its composite with the projection pr X,Y : [A op ⊗ A , V ](T F , T G ) / / V (F (Y X ), G(Y X ))$to be the projection

$pr Y X : [A , V ](F, G) / / V (F (Y X ), G(Y X )).$Proposition 4.1. The Cayley V -functor Υ is strong monoidal; it takes Day convolution to composition of endomodules.

Proof. We have the calculation:

$(Υ(F ) ⊗ A Υ(G))(X, Y ) = Z Υ(F )(X, Z) ⊗ Υ(G)(Z, Y ) = Z F (Z X ) ⊗ G(Y Z ) ∼ = Z,U,V A (U, Z X ) ⊗ F U ⊗ A (V, Y Z ) ⊗ GV ∼ = Z,U,V A (X ⊗ U, Z) ⊗ F U ⊗ A (Z ⊗ V, Y ) ⊗ GV ∼ = U,V A (X ⊗ U ⊗ V, Y ) ⊗ F U ⊗ GV ∼ = U,V A (U ⊗ V, Y X ) ⊗ F U ⊗ GV ∼ = Υ(F * G)(X, Y ), and of course Υ(A (I, -))(X, Y ) = A (I, Y X ) ∼ = A (X, Y ).$In fact, Υ lands in the left Tambara modules by defining, for each

$F ∈ [A , V ], the structure α l (A, X, Y ) = F (Y X ) F ((dr) X ) / / F ((A ⊗ Y ) A⊗X )$on T F . It is helpful to observe that the β l corresponding to this α l (via Proposition 3.1) is given by the identity

$β l (A, X, Y ) = F (Y A⊗X ) 1 / / F (Y A⊗X ) ,$showing that T F becomes a strong left module. To see that there is a V -functor Υ :

$[A , V ] / / LTamb s (A ) satisfying ι • Υ = Υ, we merely observe that pr A⊗X,Y • Υ F,G = pr Y A⊗X = pr (Y A ) X = pr X,Y A • Υ F,G . Proposition 4.2. If A is a right closed monoidal V -category then the V -functor Υ : [A , V ] / / LTamb s (A ) is an equivalence. Proof. Define ζ : LTamb(A )(T F , T G ) / / [A , V ](F, G) by pr Y • ζ = pr I,Y • ι TF ,TG . Then pr Y • ζ • ΥF,G = pr I,Y • ι TF ,TG • ΥF,G = pr I,Y • Υ F,G = pr Y and pr X,Y • ι TF ,TG • ΥF,G • ζ = pr X,Y • Υ F,G • ζ = pr Y X • ζ = pr I,Y X • ι TF ,TG = pr X,Y • ι TF ,TG .$It follows that ζ is the inverse of ΥF,G , so that Υ is fully faithful. To see that Υ is essentially surjective on objects, take a strong left module T . Put F Y = T (I, Y ) as a V -functor in Y . Then the isomorphism β l (X, I, Y ) yields

$T F (X, Y ) = F (Y X ) = T (I, Y X ) ∼ = T (X, Y ); so Υ(F ) ∼ = T . Now suppose we have an object (F, θ) of the lax centre Z l [A , V ] of [A , V ]. Then T F becomes a right Tambara module by defining α r (B, X, Y ) = F (Y X ) F ( B (Y ⊗ B) X ) F ((d l ) X ) / / F (Y ⊗ B) X⊗B θ B,(Y ⊗B) X / / .$If A is left closed, the β r corresponding to this α r (via Proposition 3.1) is defined by

$β r (B, X, Y ) = F ( B Y X ) θ B,Y X / / F (Y X⊗B ) .$It is easy to see that, in this way, T F = Υ(F ) actually becomes a (two-sided) Tambara module which we write as Υ(F, θ), and we have a V -functor Υ :

$Z l [A , V ] / / Tamb ls (A ). Proposition 4.3. If A is a closed monoidal V -category then the V -functor Υ : Z l [A , V ] / / Tamb ls (A )$is an equivalence which restricts to an equivalence

$Υ : Z[A , V ] / / Tamb s (A ).$Proof. The proof of full faithfulness proceeds along the lines of the beginning of the proof of Proposition 4.2. For essential surjectivity on objects, take a left strong Tambara module (T, α).

$Then β l (A, X, Y ) : T (X, Y A ) / / T (A ⊗ X, Y ) is invert- ible. Define the V -functor F : A / / V by F X = T (I, X)$as in the proof of Proposition 4.2, and define θ A,Y : F ( A Y )

/ / F (Y A ) to be the composite

$T (I, A Y ) T (A, Y ) βr(A,I,Y ) / / T (I, Y A ) β l (A,I,Y ) -1 / / .$This is easily seen to yield an object (F, θ) of the lax centre Z l [A , V ] with Υ(F, θ) ∼ = T F . Thus we have the first equivalence. Clearly θ is invertible if and only if β r is; the second equivalence follows.

## The double monad

Tambara modules are actually Eilenberg-Moore coalgebras for a fairly obvious comonad on [A op ⊗ A , V ]. We begin by looking at the case of left modules.

Let Θ l : [A op ⊗ A , V ] / / [A op ⊗ A , V ] be the V -functor defined by the end

$Θ l (T )(X, Y ) = A T (A ⊗ X, A ⊗ Y ).$There is a V -natural family ǫ T : Θ l (T ) / / T defined by the projections

$pr I : A T (A ⊗ X, A ⊗ Y ) / / T (X, Y ).$There is a V -natural family δ T : Θ l (T ) / / Θ l (Θ l (T )) defined by taking its composite with the projection pr B,C :

$B,C T (B ⊗ C ⊗ X, B ⊗ C ⊗ Y ) / / T (B ⊗ C ⊗ X, B ⊗ C ⊗ Y )$to be the projection

$pr B⊗C : A T (A ⊗ X, A ⊗ Y ) / / T (B ⊗ C ⊗ X, B ⊗ C ⊗ Y ). It is now easily checked that Θ l = (Θ l , δ, ǫ) is a comonad on [A op ⊗ A , V ]. There are also a comonad Θ r [A op ⊗ A , V ], a distributive law Θ r Θ l ∼ = Θ l Θ r , and a comonad Θ = Θ r Θ l : Θ r (T )(X, Y ) = B T (X ⊗ B, Y ⊗ B) and Θ(T )(X, Y ) = A,B T (A ⊗ X ⊗ B, A ⊗ Y ⊗ B).$We can easily identify the V -categories of Eilenberg-Moore coalgebras for these three comonads.

Proposition 5.1. There are isomorphisms of V -categories

$• [A op ⊗ A , V ] Θ l ∼ = LTamb(A ), • [A op ⊗ A , V ] Θr ∼ = RTamb(A ), and • [A op ⊗ A , V ] Θ ∼ = Tamb(A ).$In fact, Θ l , Θ r and Θ are all monoidal comonads on [A op ⊗ A , V ]. For example, the structure on Θ l is provided by the V -natural transformations Θ l (T )

$⊗ A Θ l (T ′ ) / / Θ l (T ⊗ A T ′ ) and A (-, -) / / Θ l (A (-, -)) with components (1) Z A T (A⊗X, A⊗Z)⊗ B T ′ (B ⊗X, B ⊗Z) / / C U T (C ⊗X, U )⊗T ′ (U, C ⊗Y ) and (2) A (X, Y ) / / A A (A ⊗ X, A ⊗ Y )$defined as follows. The morphism (1) is determined by its precomposite with the coprojection copr Z and postcomposite with the projection pr C ; the result is defined to be the composite

$A T (A ⊗ X, A ⊗ Z)⊗ B T ′ (B ⊗ X, B ⊗ Z) pr C ⊗ pr C / / T (C ⊗ X, C ⊗ Z) ⊗ T ′ (C ⊗ Z, C ⊗ Y ) copr C⊗Z / / U T (C ⊗ X, U ) ⊗ T ′ (U, C ⊗ Y ) .$The morphism (2) is simply the coprojection copr I . It follows that [A op ⊗ A , V ] Θ l becomes monoidal with the underlying functor becoming strong monoidal; see [[Moe02]](#b7) and [[McC02]](#b6). Clearly we have:

Proposition 5.2. The isomorphisms of Proposition 5.1 are monoidal.

The next thing to observe is that Θ l , Θ r and Θ all have left adjoints Φ l , Φ r and Φ which therefore become opmonoidal monads whose V -categories of Eilenberg-Moore algebras are monoidally isomorphic to LTamb(A ), RTamb(A ) and Tamb(A ), respectively. Straightforward applications of the Yoneda Lemma, show that the formulas for these adjoints are

$Φ l (S)(U, V ) = A,X,Y A (U, A ⊗ X) ⊗ A (A ⊗ Y, V ) ⊗ S(X, Y ), Φ r (S)(U, V ) = B,X,Y A (U, X ⊗ B) ⊗ A (Y ⊗ B, V ) ⊗ S(X, Y ), and Φ(S)(U, V ) = A,B,X,Y A (U, A ⊗ X ⊗ B) ⊗ A (A ⊗ Y ⊗ B, V ) ⊗ S(X, Y ).$Recall that left adjoint V -functors Ψ : [X op , V ] / / [Y op , V ] are equivalent to V -functors Ψ : Y op ⊗ X / / V , which are also called modules Ψ : X / / Y from X to Y . The equivalence is defined by: Ψ(Y, X) = Ψ(X (-, X))(Y )

and

$Ψ(M )(Y ) = X Ψ(Y, X) ⊗ M (X).$It follows that Φ l , Φ r and Φ determine monads Φl , Φr and Φ on A op ⊗ A in the bicategory V -Mod. The formulas are:

$Φl (X, Y, U, V ) = A A (U, A ⊗ X) ⊗ A (A ⊗ Y, V ), Φr (X, Y, U, V ) = B A (U, X ⊗ B) ⊗ A (Y ⊗ B, V ), and Φ(X, Y, U, V ) = A,B A (U, A ⊗ X ⊗ B) ⊗ A (A ⊗ Y ⊗ B, V ).$
## Doubles

The bicategory V -Mod admits the Kleisli construction for monads. Write D l A , D r A and DA for the Kleisli V -categories for the monads Φl , Φr and Φ on A op ⊗A in the bicategory V -Mod. We call them the left double, right double and double of the monoidal V -category A . They all have the same objects as A op ⊗ A . The homs are defined by

$D l A ((X, Y ), (U, V )) = A A (U, A ⊗ X) ⊗ A (A ⊗ Y, V ), D r A ((X, Y ), (U, V )) = B A (U, X ⊗ B) ⊗ A (Y ⊗ B, V ), and DA ((X, Y ), (U, V )) = A,B A (U, A ⊗ X ⊗ B) ⊗ A (A ⊗ Y ⊗ B, V ).$Proposition 6.1. There are canonical equivalences of V -categories:

$• Ξ l : LTamb(A ) ≃ [D l A , V ], • Ξ r : RTamb(A ) ≃ [D r A , V ],$and

$• Ξ : Tamb(A ) ≃ [DA , V ].$It follows from the main result of [Day [Day70]](#) that these doubles D l A , D r A and DA all admit promonoidal structures (P l , J l ), (P r , J r ) and (P, J) for which the equivalences in Proposition 6.1 become monoidal when the right-hand sides are given the corresponding convolution structures. For example, we calculate that P l and J l are as follows:

$P l ((X, Y ),(U, V ); (H, K)) = (D l A ((X, Y ), -) ⊗ A D l A ((U, V ), -))(H, K) = Z,A,B A (H, A ⊗ X) ⊗ A (A ⊗ Y, Z) ⊗ A (Z, B ⊗ U ) ⊗ A (B ⊗ V, K) = A,B A (H, A ⊗ X) ⊗ A (A ⊗ Y, B ⊗ U ) ⊗ A (B ⊗ V, K)$and J l (H, K) = A (H, K). Furthermore, there are some special morphisms that exist in these doubles D l A , D r A and DA . Let αl : (X, Y ) / / (A ⊗ X, A ⊗ Y ) denote the morphism in D l A defined by the composite

$I A (A ⊗ X, A ⊗ X) ⊗ A (A ⊗ Y, A ⊗ Y ) jA⊗X ⊗jA⊗Y / / D l A ((X, Y ), (A ⊗ X, A ⊗ Y )) copr A / / . The V -functor Ξ l has the property that Ξ l (T, α l )(X, Y ) = T (X, Y ) and Ξ l (T, α l )(α l ) = α l . When A is right closed, we let βl : (X, Y A ) / / (A ⊗ X, Y ) denote the mor- phism in D l A defined by the composite I A (A ⊗ X, A ⊗ X) ⊗ A (A ⊗ Y A , Y ) jA⊗X ⊗er / / D l A ((X, Y A ), (A ⊗ X, Y )) copr A / / . Then Ξ l (T, α l )( βl ) = β l .$Similarly, we have the morphism αr : (X, Y ) / / (X ⊗ B, Y ⊗ B) in D r A , and also, when A is left closed, the morphism βr : (X, B Y ) / / (X ⊗ B, Y ). There are V -functors D l A / / DA o o D r A which are the identity functions on objects and are defined on homs using projections with B = I for the left leg and the projections A = I for the second leg. In this way, the morphisms αl and αr can be regarded also as morphisms of DA . Under closedness assumptions, the morphisms βl and βr can also be regarded as morphisms of DA .

Let Σ l denote the set of morphisms βl : (X, Y A ) / / (A ⊗ X, Y ), let Σ r denote the set of morphisms βr : (X, B Y ) / / (X ⊗ B, Y ), and let Σ denote the set of morphisms Σ = Σ l ∪ Σ r . Under appropriate closedness assumptions on A , we can form various V -categories of fractions such as:

$• LDA = D l A [Σ -1 l ] and RDA = D r A [Σ -1 r ], • D ls A = DA [Σ -1 l ] and D rs A = DA [Σ -1 r ]$, and

$• D s A = DA [Σ -1 ].$The following result is now automatic. Theorem 6.2. For a closed monoidal V -category A , there are equivalences of V -categories:

$• [LDA , V ] ≃ LTamb s (A ) ≃ [A , V ], • [D ls A , V ] ≃ Tamb ls (A ) ≃ Z l [A , V ], and • [D s A , V ] ≃ Tamb s (A ) ≃ Z[A , V ].$The first equivalence of Theorem 6.2 implies that LDA and A are Morita equivalent. This begs the question of whether there is a V -functor relating them more directly. Indeed there is. We have a V -functor Π : D l A / / A defined on objects by Π(X, Y ) = Y X and by defining the effect Π : D l A ((X, Y ), (U, V )) / / A (Y X , V U ) on hom objects to have its composite with the A-coprojection equal to the composite

$A (U, A ⊗ X) ⊗ A (A ⊗ Y, V ) V (-) ⊗(-) A⊗X / / A (V A⊗X , V U ) ⊗ A ((A ⊗ Y ) A⊗X , V A⊗X ) composition / / A ((A ⊗ Y ) A⊗X , V U ) A ((dr) X ,V U ) / / A (Y X , V U ) .$It is easy to see that Π takes the morphisms βl : (X, Y A ) / / (A ⊗ X, Y ) to isomorphisms. So Π induces a V -functor Π : LD l A / / A ; this induces the first equivalence of Theorem 6.2. For closed monoidal A , the second and third equivalences of Theorem 6.2 show that both the lax centre and the centre of the convolution monoidal V -category [A , V ] are again functor V -categories [D ls A , V ] and [D s A , V ]. Since Z l [A , V ] and Z[A , V ] are monoidal with the tensor products colimit preserving in each variable, using the correspondence in [[Day70]](#b0), there are lax braided and braided promonoidal structures on D ls A and D s A which are such that [D ls A , V ] and [D s A , V ] become closed monoidal under convolution, and the equivalences of Theorem 6.2 become lax braided and braided monoidal equivalences.

Remark. We are grateful to Brian Day for pointing out that the V -category A M appearing in [[DS07]](#b2) is equivalent to the full sub-V -category of DA consisting of the objects of the form (I, Y ).

He also pointed out that a consequence of Theorem 6.2 is that the centre of V as a V -category is equivalent to V itself. This also can be seen directly by using the V -naturality in X of the centre structure u X : A ⊗ X / / X ⊗ A on an object A of V , and the fact that u I = 1, to deduce that u X = c A,X (the symmetry of V ). Generally, the centre of V as a monoidal Set-category is not equivalent to V .
