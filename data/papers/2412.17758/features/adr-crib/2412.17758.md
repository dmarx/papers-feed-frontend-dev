The evaluation of multiple-choice problems in the context of language models (LLMs) is a nuanced area that significantly impacts perceived model performance and capabilities. Below is a detailed technical explanation of the researchers' decisions regarding various aspects of evaluation setups, particularly focusing on the transition from separation to options in model evaluation.

### Evaluation Setup for Multiple-Choice Problems

The evaluation setup for multiple-choice problems typically involves two main configurations: **separation** and **options**. In the separation setup, each answer choice is evaluated independently, while in the options setup, all answer choices are presented simultaneously. The researchers argue that the options setup is more representative of how humans naturally approach multiple-choice questions, allowing for direct comparison among choices, which is crucial for accurate reasoning.

### Comparison of Separation vs. Options in Model Evaluation

The researchers highlight that evaluating models in separation often leads to misleading conclusions about their capabilities. For instance, when models assess answers in isolation, they may struggle with questions that inherently require comparative reasoning. The transition to an options-based evaluation significantly reduces the performance gap observed in various benchmarks, suggesting that the perceived difficulty of tasks is often an artifact of the evaluation method rather than the tasks themselves.

### Impact of Evaluation Method on Perceived Difficulty

The choice of evaluation method directly influences the perceived difficulty of a benchmark. The researchers demonstrate that switching from separation to options can lead to substantial improvements in model accuracy—up to 35% in some cases. This shift indicates that many questions previously deemed challenging may not be inherently difficult but rather difficult to evaluate under the separation method.

### Handling 'Hardly Answerable in Separation' Questions

The researchers identify a category of questions that are particularly problematic when evaluated in separation—those that require comparative reasoning. For example, questions that ask for the heaviest object among several options cannot be accurately answered without considering all choices. The researchers note that a significant portion of questions in datasets like ARC fall into this category, emphasizing the need for an evaluation method that allows for simultaneous consideration of options.

### Implications of Evaluation Practices on Benchmark Performance

The implications of evaluation practices are profound. The researchers argue that the way questions are evaluated can lead to misinterpretations of model capabilities. For instance, if a model performs poorly under a separation setup, it may be incorrectly assumed to lack reasoning abilities. By adopting an options-based evaluation, the researchers show that models can achieve performance levels that align more closely with human capabilities, thereby providing a more accurate assessment of their reasoning skills.

### Guidelines for Fair Multi-Choice Evaluations

The researchers propose several guidelines for conducting fair multi-choice evaluations:
1. **Use Options for Evaluation**: Whenever possible, present all answer choices simultaneously to allow for direct comparison.
2. **Identify 'Hardly Answerable in Separation' Questions**: Recognize and handle questions that inherently require comparative reasoning.
3. **Normalize Scores**: Implement normalization methods to ensure fair comparisons across different models and datasets.

### Transition from Separation to Options in ARC Evaluation

The transition from separation to options in the ARC evaluation is a key focus of the researchers. They document how this shift has led to a dramatic reduction in the perceived difficulty of the ARC Challenge and Easy subsets, with accuracy improvements that suggest previous evaluations may have misrepresented model capabilities.

### Effects of Evaluation Method on Model Accuracy

The researchers provide empirical evidence showing that the evaluation method significantly affects model accuracy. For example, models evaluated under the options setup consistently outperform those evaluated in separation, reinforcing the argument that the evaluation method should align with human test-taking approaches.

### Addressing Misinterpretations of Model Capabilities

The researchers emphasize the importance of accurately interpreting model capabilities based on the evaluation method used. They argue that performance discrepancies observed in benchmarks like SIQA and OpenBookQA may be misleading if the evaluation method does not reflect how humans would approach the questions.

### Consistency of Evaluation with Human Test-Taking Approaches

The researchers advocate for evaluation methods that mirror human test-taking behavior. Since humans naturally consider all options when answering multiple-choice questions, the options setup is more consistent with human reasoning processes, leading to more valid assessments of model performance.

### Normalization Methods for Aggregating Scores

Normalization methods are crucial for aggregating scores from multiple-choice evaluations. The researchers suggest that using a consistent normalization approach can help mitigate biases introduced by varying answer lengths and improve the comparability of results across different models.

### Likelihood-Based Scoring vs. Open-Ended Generation

The researchers discuss the merits of likelihood-based scoring in the context of multiple-choice evaluations. This method allows for constrained decoding, ensuring that models select from given options rather than generating open-ended responses. This approach is particularly beneficial for evaluating models that may not have been fine-tuned for open-ended generation tasks.

### Use Cases for Showing vs. Not Showing Options

The researchers acknowledge that there are scenarios where showing options may not be necessary, such as straightforward yes/no questions. However, they argue that in most cases, especially where comparative reasoning is required, presenting options is preferable to ensure accurate evaluations.

### Influence of Question Complexity on Evaluation Method Choice

The complexity of questions plays a significant
