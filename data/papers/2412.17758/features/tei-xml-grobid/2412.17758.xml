<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>ARC Challenge appears more difficult than ARC Easy for modern LLMs primarily due to an evaluation setup that prevents direct comparison of answer choices rather than inherent complexity. Although some researchers have quietly shifted to a more appropriate scheme over the last year, the implications of this change have yet to be widely acknowledged. We highlight this overlooked shift, show how similar evaluation practices falsely imply reasoning deficits in other benchmarks, and demonstrate that fairer methods dramatically reduce performance gaps (e.g. on SIQA) and even yield superhuman results (OpenBookQA). In doing so, we reveal how evaluation shapes perceived difficulty and offer guidelines to ensure that multiple-choice evaluations accurately reflect actual model capabilities.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>A substantial set of benchmarks regularly employed in LLM testing consists of multiple-choice problems, commonly considered in a setup where each provided option is scored under the model, and the one with the highest likelihood is compared against the gold standard to determine accuracy. This refers, among others, to popular evaluators of MMLU <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hendrycks et al., 2021)</ref>, ARC Easy and Challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Clark et al., 2018)</ref>, BoolQ <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Clark et al., 2019)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">RACE (Lai et al., 2017)</ref>, OpenBookQA <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Mihaylov et al., 2018)</ref>, PIQA <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bisk et al., 2019)</ref>, SIQA <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Sap et al., 2019)</ref>, COPA <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gordon et al., 2011)</ref>, and HellaSwag <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Zellers et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Details of this setup differ but generally follow one of the two conventions. Under one convention, the model considers each candidate answer in separation , without alternative options displayed (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>), while under the other, the model sees all candidate options together in the prompt (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Hardly answerable in separation</head><p>Consider the question, 'Which of these items contains only a solution?' Given the option 'a jar of pickles,' confronting a single item with a question and assessing whether pickles fulfill the definition of the solution suffices. They do not, so this option is incorrect. The question can be addressed under both evaluation setups because it does not require the availability of other options, such as 'a can of mixed fruit.'</p><p>Q: How is a pond different from a lake?

Because options may vary in length, it is a good practice to normalize them <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Gao, 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Q:</head><p>How is a pond different from a lake? In contrast, some questions inherently demand comparative evaluation: let us think about 'Which of these most likely has the greatest mass?' and the option 'puppy.' This question's answer cannot be determined without comparing the mass of the 'puppy' to the masses of all other provided options. It is the greatest compared to 'chicken' or 'lizard' but not in the context of 'horse' or 'elephant.' Though it can work to some extent, relying on the likelihood assigned in separation to each of the animals is an unreasonable way of determining the heaviest one. It feels natural to provide the model with the options to choose from instead because it allows the model to directly compare and contextualize choices, reflecting a more authentic reasoning process. This aspect, however, is commonly overlooked.</p><p>Specifically, such 'hardly answerable in separation' questions are prevalent in ARC datasets, constituting 21% of ARC Easy and 31% of ARC Challenge (see Appendix B). Despite this fact, it is widespread to evaluate them without seeing all of the options simultaneously <ref type="bibr">(Touvron et al., 2023a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Peng et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">01. AI et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gemma Team et al., 2024b, inter alia)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Impact on evaluation results</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows the difference in model accuracy when options are presented in isolation versus all at once. Not surprisingly, different setups hugely change the evaluation results, partly because of the vast presence of 'hardly answerable in separation' questions and partially because such a setup, equivalent to what human test takers see, doesn't introduce unnecessary obstacles.</p><p>For example, switching from separation to options improves the Llama 3.1 70B ARC Challenge accuracy from 64% to 93%, rendering this ARC subset significantly less challenging. Moreover, since the procedure change has a much higher impact on ARC Challenge than on ARC Easy, switching reduces the accuracy gap between these subsets as much as six-fold (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). These findings suggest that the previously perceived difficulty was primarily an artifact of the evaluation method rather than the tasks' complexity.</p><p>The difference seems somewhat known in the LLM community, but not broadly, and needs to be stated explicitly. E.g. concerning the Llama family, authors seem to silently switch from separation to options between Llama 2 and Llama 3, similar to Mistral between Mixtral 8x7B and Mixtral 8x22B, or DeepSeek before their V2 (detailed assessment available in Appendix A).</p><p>3 Are other benchmarks affected?</p><p>Yes. Analogous changes in evaluation procedures would vastly improve OpenBookQA scores. Concerning Llama 3.1 70B, one can achieve improvement from 48% to 89% (see Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>). For some reason, most authors who switched from separation to options in ARC evaluation did not follow on some other multi-choice problems.</p><p>If they switched, they could notice that Open-BookQA is essentially solved, as current models achieve scores above human performance (92% compared to 96% of Qwen 2.5 72B).</p><p>In the case of SIQA, reformulation leads to a 24% increase in Llama 70B accuracy. However, the best models perform 5% below the human baseline,</p><p>0% 25% 50% 75% 100% Mistral Large Qwen 2.5 72B Qwen 2.5 32B Llama 3.1 70B Yi 1.5 34B Mixtral 8x22B Mixtral 8x7B Llama 3.1 8B 82% 85% 91% 93% 93% 94% 95% 95% 55% 66% 67% 60% 64% 59% 63% 67% Separation Options 1 Figure 4: ARC Challenge evaluation results depending on whether the model sees other options or considers each answer separately.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Why does it matter?</head><p>We argue that the benchmark's challenge should result from the inherent complexity of the knowledge or reasoning required, not its formulation or evaluation procedure.</p><p>The separation setup is unnecessarily complicated and not consistent with how humans would approach the multi-choice problem, leading to existing assessments of human performance being incompatible. For example, the fact that strong LLMs perform 30% worse than humans on SIQA doesn't mean they are deficient in commonsense reasoning about social situations if under options the difference largely disappears. This mismatch can falsely suggest deficits in reasoning capabilities that are not truly present.</p><p>0% 50% 100% Llama 3.1 8B Llama 3.1 70B Mistral Large Qwen 2.5 72B 81% 76% 76% 66% 63% 52% 52% 50% Separation Options OpenBookQA Llama 3.1 8B 45% 74% Llama 3.1 70B 48% 89% Mistral Large 53% 91% Qwen 2.5 72B 47% 96% SocialIQA Llama 3.1 8B 50% 66% Llama 3.1 70B 52% 76% Mistral Large 52% 76% Qwen 2.5 72B 63% 81% Llama 3.1 405B 56% 75% -30% -23% -15% -8% 0% Yi 1.5 34B Mixtral 8x22B Mixtral 8x7B Llama 3.1 8B -11% -9% -6% -5% -25% -19% -18% -22% Human 1 Figure 6: SIQA evaluation results depending on whether the model sees other options or considers each answer separately.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Suggestions for multi-choice eval</head><p>There are many arguments for using the options for the evaluation of multi-choice QA problems. We have already described a few, including the presence of 'hardly answerable in separation' questions and the fact it is consistent with the usual approach to assessing human performance, as humans naturally consider all choices in a single context.</p><p>Other benefits include enabling compatible evaluation in a likelihood and generative manner, allowing one to obtain comparable scores with LLMs behind closed and limited APIs. Moreover, it eliminates the need to decide which normalization method to use when aggregating scores from several option tokens, which is, to some extent, arbitrary and impacts model ranking.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is not preferred in all cases commonly considered under the likelihood-scoring evaluation scheme.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Why likelihood scoring in the first place?</head><p>Likelihood-based scoring is a natural choice for problems from pure language modeling, Winograd schemas, or fill-in-the-gap setups such as encountered in LAMBADA <ref type="bibr">(Paperno et al., 2016)</ref>, Hel-laSwag <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bisk et al., 2019)</ref>, or WindoGrande <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Sakaguchi et al., 2019)</ref> datasets.</p><p>For other problems, it is effectively a variant of constrained decoding, that is, the model is restricted to selecting from given candidate options rather than generating open-ended text. It guarantees that models will not emit CoTs before answering the question and removes the need for output postprocessing, such as extracting the letter associated with the selected option and normalizing its casing. Moreover, it allows us to obtain meaningful results with base models, e.g. intermediate checkpoints from LLMs' self-supervised pretraining since we are constraining the output to one of the most probable options under the model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">To show, or not to show options</head><p>Suppose the options are of equal length, and it is not helpful to consider them simultaneously. This is the case when we deal with a straightforward yes/no response, and no comparative reasoning is necessary, as in the BoolQ dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Clark et al., 2019)</ref>. In similar scenarios, there are no arguments for dropping separation in favor of options .</p><p>We are in the position that the options variant is preferred if there is a risk of a 'hardly answerable in separation' question presence (Section 1.1) or it simply makes it easier to consider all of the options at once because it ensures the model can leverage direct comparisons. This seems to be the case for virtually all other multi-choice QA problems, such as MMLU <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hendrycks et al., 2021)</ref>, ARC <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Clark et al., 2018)</ref>, OpenBookQA <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Mihaylov et al., 2018)</ref>, PIQA <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bisk et al., 2019)</ref>, or SIQA <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Sap et al., 2019)</ref>. In fact, most similar problems are already being evaluated in the options scheme.</p><p>Arguably, options has some possible or actual disadvantages: the order of the presented choices might impact the evaluation results (e.g. models might bias toward the first listed choice), it might be easier to exploit pattern recognition, and the setup requires slightly more compute. Nevertheless, we consider these to be outweighed by benefits and recommend broad use of the options</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>Despite our recommendations and the benefits they entail, several limitations and uncertainties exist in identifying precisely how evaluation methods were employed in previously reported results.</p><p>Firstly, because authors of LLMs' technical reports rarely or never report such details, our assessment of which of the options and separation they employed is based on attempting to replicate reported accuracy scores under both setups and observing which condition aligns best (Appendix A). Fortunately, given the magnitude of the observed differences, the performance gap is so large that one can differentiate between the mentioned approaches with a high degree of certainty.</p><p>Secondly, in a search for the separation overuse candidates, we mainly relied on intuition. We considered the most popular benchmarks due to their widespread use and availability of performance data, later confirming the intuition experimentally. Though it was a tale of ARC, Open-BookQA, and SIQA, many widely used benchmarks may benefit from revisiting their evaluation setup.</p><p>Finally, it could be a blog post, but it feels better to write a PDF.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Summary</head><p>We draw the community's attention to shifting from evaluating answers in isolation to evaluating them alongside all other options. Over the last year, such a change happened in the reported ARC Challenge and ARC Easy scores, vastly impacting their evaluation results. After discussing the implications, we considered whether other popular benchmarks might undergo similar reformulation, identifying OpenBookQA and SIQA as candidates. In the former, recent models outperform humans, even though there is a room of 40% between humans and LLMs in the widespread setup. The fact that the gap drastically narrows under the all-options evaluation method highlights how the testing format can distort perceived difficulty.</p><p>We concluded with a guideline for evaluating multi-choice problems, arguing that the setup where the model sees all options is preferred over considering each answer separately, except for casual or masked language modeling problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Claiming setup used by other authors</head><p>As authors of LLM technical reports rarely or never provide such details, we redo their evaluations in options and separation setups. If the reported score is in the same ballpark as one of these, and visibly distant from the other one, we claim they used the first. This assessment is backed by the notion that no other change in the prompt could cause a 20%+ improvement in ARC Challenge scores. The exception could be using a generative setup with CoT for some heavy reasoners, but we do not suspect authors to use CoT if they are not reporting this because it would be a serious flaw.</p><p>The results of this analysis for the ARC Challenge are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">1</ref>. Prompt 'reverse engineering' becomes more troublesome in the context of SIQA and OpenBookQA datasets (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>-3) as some authors do not directly report scores but average them with other commonsense reasoning problems. We're not claiming any setup for these.</p><p>Finally, some authors tackling OpenBookQA followed <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brown et al. (2020)</ref> in normalizing the likelihood by the likelihood of the completion given 'Answer:' as context. To address this possibility, we introduce two additional variants referred to as separation b and options b .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B Estimating number of questions hardly answerable in separation</head><p>To determine whether questions are answerable given a single option or require the context of other options, we process them in batches of 20 using gpt-4o-2024-11-20 model and the following prompt with few-shot examples:</p><p>Consider the question, "Which of these items ‚Üí contains only a solution?" Given the ‚Üí option "a jar of pickles," confronting a ‚Üí single item with a question and assessing ‚Üí whether pickles fulfill the definition ‚Üí of the solution suffices. They do not, so ‚Üí this option is incorrect. Now let us think about "Which of these most ‚Üí likely has the greatest mass?" and the ‚Üí option "puppy." It can be considered only ‚Üí with other options because it is the ‚Üí greatest compared to "chicken" or "lizard ‚Üí " but not in the context of "horse" or " ‚Üí elephant".</p><p>These questions represent two classes of ‚Üí questions: "answerable without other ‚Üí options" and "unanswerable without other ‚Üí options". Other examples of "answerable without other ‚Üí options" are: -Kerry made a simple flashlight. She recorded ‚Üí the following statements in her lab book. ‚Üí Which statement is an inference? ( ‚Üí Answerable, because it suffices to ‚Üí compare options against the definition of ‚Üí inference) -A scientist on a field trip discovered a new ‚Üí organism.
