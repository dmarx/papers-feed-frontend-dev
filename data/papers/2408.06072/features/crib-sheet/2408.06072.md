- **CogVideoX Overview**: A text-to-video diffusion model designed for generating long-duration, high-resolution videos with coherent actions and rich semantics.
  
- **Key Innovations**:
  - **3D Causal VAE**: Compresses video data along spatial and temporal dimensions, reducing sequence length and preventing flicker.
  - **Expert Transformer**: Utilizes expert adaptive Layer-Norm for better alignment between video and text modalities.
  - **3D Full Attention**: Comprehensive modeling of video data along both temporal and spatial dimensions to ensure consistency in large motions.

- **Training Techniques**:
  - **Progressive Training**: Involves multi-resolution frame pack and resolution progressive training to enhance performance and stability.
  - **Explicit Uniform Sampling**: Improves training stability by ensuring uniform distribution of timesteps across data parallel ranks.

- **Model Specifications**:
  - Two parameter sizes: 5 billion and 2 billion.
  - Capable of generating videos up to 768×1360 resolution, 10 seconds in length, at 16fps.

- **Evaluation**: CogVideoX-5B outperforms existing models in both machine and human evaluations, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

- **Architecture Details**:
  - **Input Processing**: Video latents (T × H × W × C) are patchified to create a sequence for processing.
  - **3D-RoPE**: Extended Rotary Position Embedding for effective modeling of video data.
  - **Expert Adaptive Layernorm**: Handles different modalities independently to align feature spaces.

- **Loss Functions**: Combines L1 reconstruction loss, LPIPS perceptual loss, KL loss, and GAN loss for effective training.

- **Data Handling**: Mixed-duration training to utilize videos of varying lengths, employing Multi-Resolution Frame Pack for consistent batch shapes.

- **Future Work**: Exploration of larger compression ratios in VAE for improved video quality and continuity.
