  "abstract": "We present CogVideoX, a large-scale text-to-video generation model based on\ndiffusion transformer, which can generate 10-second continuous videos aligned\nwith text prompt, with a frame rate of 16 fps and resolution of 768 * 1360\npixels. Previous video generation models often had limited movement and short\ndurations, and is difficult to generate videos with coherent narratives based\non text. We propose several designs to address these issues. First, we propose\na 3D Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to compress videos along both spatial and\ntemporal dimensions, to improve both compression rate and video fidelity.\nSecond, to improve the text-video alignment, we propose an expert transformer\nwith the expert adaptive LayerNorm to facilitate the deep fusion between the\ntwo modalities. Third, by employing a progressive training and multi-resolution\nframe pack technique, CogVideoX is adept at producing coherent, long-duration,\ndifferent shape videos characterized by significant motions. In addition, we\ndevelop an effective text-video data processing pipeline that includes various\ndata preprocessing strategies and a video captioning method, greatly\ncontributing to the generation quality and semantic alignment. Results show\nthat CogVideoX demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across both multiple\nmachine metrics and human evaluations. The model weight of both 3D Causal VAE,\nVideo caption model and CogVideoX are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/THUDM/CogVideo.",
