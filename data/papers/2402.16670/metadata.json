  "title": "Pay Attention: a Call to Regulate the Attention Market and Prevent\n  Algorithmic Emotional Governance",
  "authors": "Franck Michel, Fabien Gandon",
  "abstract": "Over the last 70 years, we, humans, have created an economic market where\nattention is being captured and turned into money thanks to advertising. During\nthe last two decades, leveraging research in psychology, sociology,\nneuroscience and other domains, Web platforms have brought the process of\ncapturing attention to an unprecedented scale. With the initial commonplace\ngoal of making targeted advertising more effective, the generalization of\nattention-capturing techniques and their use of cognitive biases and emotions\nhave multiple detrimental side effects such as polarizing opinions, spreading\nfalse information and threatening public health, economies and democracies.\nThis is clearly a case where the Web is not used for the common good and where,\nin fact, all its users become a vulnerable population. This paper brings\ntogether contributions from a wide range of disciplines to analyze current\npractices and consequences thereof. Through a set of propositions and\nprinciples that could be used do drive further works, it calls for actions\nagainst these practices competing to capture our attention on the Web, as it\nwould be unsustainable for a civilization to allow attention to be wasted with\nimpunity on a world-wide scale.",
