- **Hexagonal Lattice Definition**: A hexagonal lattice \( H \) has vertices defined by 
  \[
  V(H) := \{(x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : x = \sqrt{3}x' + y\sqrt{3}/2, y = 3y'/2, x', y' \in \mathbb{Z}, c \in \{0, 1\}\}
  \]
  where each vertex connects to three nearest neighbors.

- **Triangular Lattice Definition**: A triangular lattice \( T \) is defined as 
  \[
  V(T) := \{v \in V(H) : c = 0\}
  \]
  with each vertex connecting to six nearest neighbors.

- **Closed Paths on Lattices**: The number of closed paths of length \( k \) on a lattice \( L \) is denoted as \( \mu_k(L) \) and is given by 
  \[
  \mu_k(G_n) = \frac{1}{n} \text{tr}(A^k) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \lambda_j^k
  \]
  where \( \lambda_j \) are the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix \( A \).

- **Empirical Spectral Distribution (ESD)**: The empirical distribution function for a graph \( G_n \) is defined as 
  \[
  F_{\rho_{G_n}}(x) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} 1_{\{\lambda_j \leq x\}}
  \]
  where \( \rho_{G_n} \) is the distribution of random eigenvalues.

- **Spectral Density Definition**: For infinite graphs, the spectral density \( \rho_L \) is defined through its moments:
  \[
  R_x^k d\rho_L(x) = \mu_k(L), \quad k \in \mathbb{N}
  \]

- **Conjecture 1**: The sequence of random fullerenes \( F_n \) converges locally weakly towards the planar hexagonal lattice \( H \).

- **Integral Representation of Bessel Functions**: The paper provides a novel integral representation for series involving third powers of modified Bessel functions, crucial for approximating random eigenvalues.

- **Characteristic Functions**: Explicit forms of the characteristic functions of random eigenvalues for both hexagonal and triangular lattices are derived.

- **Key Integral Identity**: A key integral identity involving modified Bessel functions is proven, which is essential for the analysis of spectral properties.

- **Simulation Method**: A method to simulate random eigenvalues without generating the actual lattice graphs is presented, leveraging the approximation of probability distributions.

- **Paths Calculation**: The number of paths on the hexagonal lattice can be expressed using multinomial expansions, specifically for closed paths of even length \( 2k \).

- **Local Weak Convergence**: The concept of local weak convergence is defined, with implications for the convergence of empirical spectral distributions.

- **Density of States**: The density of states for the hexagonal lattice \( \rho_H \) is systematically denoted and analyzed in relation to the empirical spectral distribution of random fullerenes.
