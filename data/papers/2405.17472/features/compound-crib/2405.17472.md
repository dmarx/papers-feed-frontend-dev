### FreezeAsGuard Overview

**Technical Explanation**: FreezeAsGuard is a novel technique designed to mitigate the illegal adaptations of diffusion models by selectively freezing critical tensors. The rationale behind this approach is to limit the model's ability to learn and represent illegal adaptations while maintaining its performance for legal adaptations. By freezing specific tensors, the model's representation power in illegal classes is constrained, effectively reducing the quality of outputs generated from illegal fine-tuning without significantly impacting the model's performance on legal tasks.

### Key Problem Addressed

**Technical Justification**: Traditional methods for addressing illegal adaptations primarily focus on detection or model unlearning. However, these methods do not prevent users from relearning illegal adaptations through fine-tuning. The key problem is that once a model has been fine-tuned, the knowledge embedded in its weights can be easily relearned, allowing users to bypass any mitigation efforts. FreezeAsGuard addresses this gap by implementing a proactive approach that constrains the model's ability to adapt to illegal classes from the outset.

### Methodology

1. **Tensor Freezing**:
   - **Rationale**: The selective freezing of tensors is based on the understanding that certain tensors are more critical for representing illegal adaptations. By freezing these tensors, the model's capacity to generate illegal content is diminished.
   - **Implementation**: The tensors to be frozen are identified through a systematic evaluation of their importance in the context of illegal adaptations.

2. **Bilevel Optimization**:
   - **Technical Explanation**: This methodology combines mask learning (to determine which tensors to freeze) with model fine-tuning. The bilevel optimization framework allows for dynamic evaluation of tensor importance, adapting the freezing strategy based on the model's performance during fine-tuning.
   - **Justification**: This approach ensures that the selection of frozen tensors is not static but evolves based on the model's learning process, allowing for a more nuanced and effective mitigation strategy.

### Training Objective

The training objective is to minimize the reconstruction loss during fine-tuning, defined mathematically as:
\[
L_\theta = E_{x,y,\epsilon \sim N(0,1),t} \| \epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(E(x_t), t, \tau(y)) \|^2_2
\]
- **Explanation**: This loss function measures the difference between the noise added to the images and the noise predicted by the model. By minimizing this loss, the model learns to generate images that closely align with the input prompts while adhering to the constraints imposed by the frozen tensors.

### Performance Metrics

1. **Mitigation Power**:
   - **Justification**: The ability of FreezeAsGuard to reduce image quality in illegal adaptations by up to 37% compared to baselines demonstrates its effectiveness in limiting the model's capacity to generate illegal content.

2. **Impact on Legal Adaptations**:
   - **Rationale**: Maintaining quality within 5% of full fine-tuning on legal data is crucial for ensuring that legitimate users can still benefit from the model without significant degradation in performance.

3. **Compute Efficiency**:
   - **Technical Explanation**: By saving up to 48% GPU memory and 21% wall-clock time, FreezeAsGuard not only enhances the model's security against illegal adaptations but also improves the efficiency of the fine-tuning process.

### Evaluation Domains

The evaluation of FreezeAsGuard spans three critical domains:
- Forging public figures' portraits
- Duplicating copyrighted artworks
- Generating explicit content

**Justification**: These domains represent significant risks associated with illegal adaptations of diffusion models, making them ideal for testing the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategy.

### Importance of Tensor Selection

- **Technical Explanation**: The use of binary masks to determine which tensors to freeze is a strategic choice that allows for a targeted approach to mitigation. By optimizing for both illegal and legal classes, the method ensures that the model retains its utility for legitimate applications while effectively reducing its capacity for illegal adaptations.
- **Challenge**: The challenge lies in accurately evaluating tensor importance, given the randomness and interdependencies in weight updates during fine-tuning.

### Challenges

- **Technical Justification**: Evaluating tensor importance is complex due to the dynamic nature of model training. The interdependencies among weights mean that a change in one tensor can affect the performance of others, complicating the selection process for freezing.

By effectively mitigating illegal adaptations while preserving the model's utility for legal applications, it addresses a critical gap in existing methodologies. The combination of selective tensor freezing and bilevel optimization provides a robust framework for ensuring that diffusion models can be safely utilized in a variety
