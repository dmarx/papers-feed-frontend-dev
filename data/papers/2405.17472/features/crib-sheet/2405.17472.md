- **FreezeAsGuard Overview**: A technique to mitigate illegal adaptations of diffusion models by selectively freezing critical tensors, minimizing impact on legal adaptations.
  
- **Key Problem Addressed**: Existing methods focus on detection or model unlearning but fail to prevent users from relearning illegal adaptations through fine-tuning.

- **Methodology**:
  - **Tensor Freezing**: Selectively freeze tensors critical to illegal adaptations to limit representation power in those classes.
  - **Bilevel Optimization**: Combines mask learning and model fine-tuning to evaluate tensor importance dynamically.
  
- **Training Objective**: Minimize reconstruction loss during fine-tuning:
  \[
  L_\theta = E_{x,y,\epsilon \sim N(0,1),t} \| \epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(E(x_t), t, \tau(y)) \|^2_2
  \]
  where \(E(\cdot)\) is the encoder, \(\tau(\cdot)\) is the text encoder, and \(\epsilon_\theta(\cdot)\) is the denoising model.

- **Performance Metrics**:
  - **Mitigation Power**: FreezeAsGuard reduces image quality in illegal adaptations by up to 37% compared to baselines.
  - **Impact on Legal Adaptations**: Maintains quality within 5% of full fine-tuning on legal data.
  - **Compute Efficiency**: Saves up to 48% GPU memory and 21% wall-clock time compared to full fine-tuning.

- **Evaluation Domains**:
  - Forging public figures' portraits
  - Duplicating copyrighted artworks
  - Generating explicit content

- **Importance of Tensor Selection**: 
  - Use of binary masks to determine which tensors to freeze, optimizing for both illegal and legal classes.
  - Avoids freezing critical components that would degrade performance in legal adaptations.

- **Challenges**: 
  - Difficulty in evaluating tensor importance due to randomness and interdependencies in weight updates during fine-tuning.
