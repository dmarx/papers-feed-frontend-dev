The technical decisions made in the FreezeAsGuard framework for mitigating illegal adaptations of diffusion models are grounded in a combination of theoretical insights, empirical evidence, and practical considerations. Below is a detailed explanation of each decision:

### 1. Decision to Implement Tensor Freezing as a Mitigation Strategy
**Rationale:** Tensor freezing is employed to selectively restrict the adaptability of the model in illegal domains while preserving its performance in legal domains. This approach minimizes the risk of illegal adaptations by preventing the model from learning representations that could be exploited for generating illegal content. By freezing specific tensors, the model retains its general capabilities while limiting its ability to adapt to harmful use cases.

### 2. Choice of Diffusion Model Architecture (e.g., UNet)
**Rationale:** The UNet architecture is chosen due to its proven effectiveness in image generation tasks, particularly in diffusion models. Its encoder-decoder structure allows for efficient feature extraction and reconstruction, which is essential for generating high-quality images. The architecture's skip connections facilitate the preservation of spatial information, which is crucial for maintaining the quality of generated images across various domains.

### 3. Selection of Illegal and Legal Class Definitions for Evaluation
**Rationale:** The definitions of illegal and legal classes are critical for evaluating the effectiveness of the mitigation strategy. Illegal classes are defined based on the potential for misuse (e.g., public figures' portraits, copyrighted artworks, explicit content), while legal classes encompass benign or user-generated content. This distinction allows for a focused assessment of the model's performance in both contexts, ensuring that the mitigation strategy effectively reduces illegal adaptations without compromising legal use cases.

### 4. Method for Evaluating Tensor Importance in Fine-Tuning
**Rationale:** The evaluation of tensor importance is conducted through a bilevel optimization framework that considers the impact of weight variations during fine-tuning. This method allows for a dynamic assessment of tensor contributions to the model's performance, enabling the selection of tensors to freeze based on their relevance to illegal adaptations. This approach addresses the limitations of static importance metrics, which may not capture the complexities of model behavior during training.

### 5. Approach to Bilevel Optimization for Mask Learning
**Rationale:** Bilevel optimization is employed to simultaneously learn a binary mask for tensor freezing while fine-tuning the model. This dual-level approach allows for the integration of feedback from both illegal and legal classes, ensuring that the selected frozen tensors do not hinder the model's performance in legal adaptations. The iterative nature of this optimization enables the model to adaptively refine the mask based on training data.

### 6. Criteria for Determining the Ratio of Frozen Tensors
**Rationale:** The ratio of frozen tensors is determined based on empirical evaluations of model performance across various tasks. This ratio is critical for balancing the trade-off between mitigating illegal adaptations and maintaining the model's adaptability in legal contexts. The chosen ratio is informed by experiments that assess the impact of different freezing levels on image quality and representation power.

### 7. Strategy for Incorporating Legal Class Samples in Training
**Rationale:** Legal class samples are incorporated into the training process to provide a counterbalance to the illegal class data. This inclusion helps to ensure that the model retains its ability to generate high-quality images in legal contexts while mitigating the risk of illegal adaptations. By training on both classes, the model can learn to differentiate between legal and illegal content more effectively.

### 8. Decision on Performance Metrics for Evaluation (e.g., CLIP, TOPIQ, FID)
**Rationale:** The selection of performance metrics is based on their ability to capture different aspects of image quality and relevance. CLIP measures the alignment between generated images and text prompts, TOPIQ assesses perceptual quality, and FID evaluates the distribution of generated images relative to real images. Using a combination of these metrics provides a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance across various dimensions.

### 9. Choice of Datasets for Testing Illegal Adaptations
**Rationale:** The datasets chosen for testing illegal adaptations are selected based on their relevance to the defined illegal classes. These datasets may include publicly available images of public figures, copyrighted artworks, and explicit content. The choice of datasets ensures that the evaluation is grounded in real-world scenarios where illegal adaptations are likely to occur.

### 10. Method for Guiding Users in Adopting Tensor Freezing
**Rationale:** User guidance is essential for the successful implementation of tensor freezing. The framework provides clear instructions and best practices for users to follow during fine-tuning. This guidance is designed to be accessible, ensuring that even non-expert users can effectively adopt the mitigation strategy without compromising their intended use of the model.

### 11. Evaluation of Compute Efficiency and Resource Savings
**Rationale:** The evaluation of compute efficiency is conducted to demonstrate the practical benefits of tensor freezing. By quantifying the reductions in GPU memory usage and wall-clock time, the framework highlights the resource savings associated with the proposed method. This efficiency is a compelling argument for users to adopt tensor freezing, as it lowers the computational burden of fine-tuning.
