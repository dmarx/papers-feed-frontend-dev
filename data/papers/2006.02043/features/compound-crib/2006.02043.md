### Detailed Technical Explanations and Justifications for Hierarchical Forecasting Decisions

#### Hierarchical Forecasting (HF)

Hierarchical Forecasting (HF) is a structured approach to forecasting that recognizes the natural organization of data into hierarchies. For instance, in retail, SKU demand can be forecasted at various levels: individual stores, regions, and national levels. The rationale for HF lies in its ability to provide coherent forecasts across these levels, ensuring that the forecasts at lower levels align with those at higher levels. This coherence is crucial for effective decision-making, as it prevents discrepancies that could arise from independent forecasting at different levels.

#### Coherence in Forecasting

Coherence in forecasting is the principle that forecasts at lower levels of a hierarchy should sum to the forecasts at higher levels. This property is essential for maintaining alignment in decision-making processes across different organizational functions. If forecasts are incoherent, it can lead to conflicting decisions, inefficiencies, and misallocation of resources. The HF framework aims to ensure that all forecasts are consistent, thereby enhancing the reliability of the forecasting process.

#### Traditional Approaches

1. **Bottom-Up (BU)**:
   - In the BU approach, forecasts are generated at the most granular level (e.g., individual SKUs) and then aggregated to higher levels. This method leverages detailed data but can be computationally intensive and may struggle with noise in the data.
   - **Formula**: \( G = [0_{m_k \times (m - m_k)} | I_{m_k}] \)
   - **Justification**: The BU approach is beneficial for operational decisions where detailed forecasts are necessary. However, it may overlook broader trends captured at higher levels.

2. **Top-Down (TD)**:
   - The TD approach generates forecasts at the highest level and disaggregates them to lower levels using historical or relative proportions.
   - **Disaggregation Methods**:
     - Historical proportions: \( p_j = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^{n} Y_{j,t} \)
     - Relative proportions: \( p_j = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n} Y_{j,t}}{\sum_{t=1}^{n} Y_t} \)
   - **Justification**: TD is resource-efficient and suitable for strategic planning. However, it can lead to inaccuracies at lower levels due to information loss during aggregation.

3. **Middle-Out (MO)**:
   - The MO approach forecasts at an intermediate level, allowing for aggregation and disaggregation to derive forecasts for lower and higher levels.
   - **Justification**: This method balances the granularity of BU and the strategic focus of TD, but it still may not fully utilize information from all levels.

4. **Combination Approaches (COM)**:
   - COM methods utilize information from all levels to produce coherent forecasts, often resulting in improved accuracy.
   - **Justification**: By combining forecasts, COM approaches mitigate the limitations of BU, TD, and MO, leading to more reliable and coherent forecasts.

#### Limitations of Traditional Methods

Traditional methods often focus on specific levels, leading to a myopic view that can result in the loss of valuable information from other levels. This limitation can hinder the accuracy and coherence of forecasts, making it essential to explore more integrative approaches.

#### Proposed Machine Learning (ML) Approach

1. **Non-linear Combination**:
   - The proposed ML approach allows for non-linear combinations of base forecasts, which can capture complex relationships that linear methods may miss.
   - **Justification**: Non-linear methods can adapt better to varying patterns across different series, enhancing forecasting accuracy.

2. **Dual Objectives**:
   - The ML approach aims for both empirical forecasting accuracy and coherence during the training phase.
   - **Justification**: By structurally integrating these objectives, the model can produce forecasts that are not only accurate but also coherent across the hierarchy.

3. **Selective Combination**:
   - The ML method can automatically combine forecasts without requiring all forecasts for each series and level.
   - **Justification**: This flexibility allows the model to focus on the most relevant information, improving efficiency and accuracy.

#### Machine Learning Algorithms Used

1. **Random Forests (RF)**:
   - A decision tree-based algorithm that captures non-linear relationships and interactions among variables.
   - **Justification**: RF is robust to overfitting and can handle high-dimensional data, making it suitable for complex hierarchical structures.

2. **XGBoost (XGB)**:
   - An efficient implementation of gradient boosting that excels in regression tasks.
   - **Justification**: XGBoost is known for its speed and performance, particularly in scenarios with large datasets and complex relationships.

#### Evaluation

The proposed ML approach is benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods using datasets from tourism and retail. The evaluation focuses on accuracy and bias reduction, demonstrating that the ML methods outperform traditional linear approaches. This empirical validation underscores the effectiveness of the proposed framework in real-world applications
