- **ZeRO-Infinity Overview**: A novel heterogeneous system technology that enables training of models with tens to hundreds of trillions of parameters on limited GPU resources without requiring model code refactoring.

- **Key Innovations**:
  - **Infinity Offload Engine**: Utilizes GPU, CPU, and NVMe memory simultaneously to support massive model sizes.
  - **Memory-Centric Tiling**: Optimizes GPU memory usage for large individual layers, eliminating the need for model parallelism.

- **Training Efficiency**:
  - **Bandwidth-Centric Partitioning**: Leverages aggregate memory bandwidth across devices for improved training efficiency.
  - **Overlap-Centric Design**: Optimizes for overlapping compute and communication, enhancing performance.

- **Ease of Use**: 
  - Eliminates the need for complex model refactoring and multiple forms of parallelism, making large model training more accessible.

- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Achieves over **25 petaflops** in throughput on 512 NVIDIA V100 GPUs (40% of peak).
  - Demonstrates **superlinear scalability** for a trillion parameter model.

- **Accessibility**: 
  - Allows fine-tuning of trillion parameter models on a single NVIDIA DGX-2 node without model parallelism or code refactoring.

- **ZeRO Framework**:
  - **ZeRO-1**: Partitions optimizer states.
  - **ZeRO-2**: Partitions optimizer states and gradients.
  - **ZeRO-3**: Partitions all three model states (optimizer states, gradients, parameters) across data-parallel processes.

- **Evaluation Results**:
  - Supports training of models with **32 trillion parameters** on 32 NVIDIA DGX-2 nodes (512 V100 GPUs).
  - Extensive evaluation of the impact of different technologies in ZeRO-Infinity on model scale and efficiency.
