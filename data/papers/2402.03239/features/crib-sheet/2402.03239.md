- **Bluesky Overview**
  - Launched in February 2023; over 10 million users by October 2024.
  - Built on the AT Protocol, enabling decentralized social media.

- **AT Protocol Goals**
  - Enable decentralization with multiple interoperable providers.
  - Facilitate easy provider switching for users.
  - Enhance user agency over content visibility.
  - Simplify user experience despite decentralized architecture.

- **Moderation Mechanisms**
  - **Content Filtering**: Automated labeling of problematic content; user preferences for visibility.
  - **Mute/Block**: Users can mute accounts/threads or block users to prevent interactions.
  - **Interaction Gating**: Control who can reply to posts.
  - **Quote Detachment**: Original post authors can detach their posts from quote replies.
  - **Takedown Reporting**: Users can report violations for moderation services to act upon.

- **User Handles**
  - Unique handles using DNS domain names (e.g., subdomains of .bsky.social).
  - Allows users to maintain handles across different servers without technical complexity.

- **Custom Feeds and Algorithmic Choice**
  - Users can select from various feed algorithms or create custom feeds.
  - Emphasis on user agency and transparency in content recommendation.

- **AT Protocol Architecture**
  - Supports multiple social modes beyond microblogging (e.g., forums, blogs).
  - Lexicons define data schema and request endpoints for interoperability.

- **User Data Repositories**
  - User actions stored in a repository using DAG-CBOR format.
  - Each user has a Personal Data Server (PDS) hosting their repository.
  - Actions are recorded without altering other users' repositories.

- **Research Opportunities**
  - Open access to Bluesky data for researchers studying social media moderation and disinformation.

- **Technical Specifications**
  - Records referenced by CIDs (cryptographic hashes) for media and inter-repository links.
  - Lexicons facilitate schema evolution and type-checking.

- **Future Directions**
  - Plans to decentralize private communications (direct messages) currently managed centrally.
