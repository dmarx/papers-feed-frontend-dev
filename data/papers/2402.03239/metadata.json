  "abstract": "Bluesky is a new social network built upon the AT Protocol, a decentralized\nfoundation for public social media. It was launched in private beta in February\n2023, and has grown to over 10 million registered users by October 2024. In\nthis paper we introduce the architecture of Bluesky and the AT Protocol, and\nexplain how the technical design of Bluesky is informed by our goals: to enable\ndecentralization by having multiple interoperable providers for every part of\nthe system; to make it easy for users to switch providers; to give users agency\nover the content they see; and to provide a simple user experience that does\nnot burden users with complexity arising from the system's decentralized\nnature. The system's openness allows anybody to contribute to content\nmoderation and community management, and we invite the research community to\nuse Bluesky as a dataset and testing ground for new approaches in social media\nmoderation.",
