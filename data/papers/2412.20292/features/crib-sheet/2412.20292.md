- **Key Contributions**:
  - First analytic theory of creativity in convolutional diffusion models.
  - Identifies two inductive biases: locality and equivariance.
  - Develops the Equivariant Local Score (ELS) machine for predicting outputs of trained models.

- **Inductive Biases**:
  - **Locality**: Model's finite receptive field size limits influence to local patches.
  - **Equivariance**: Parameter sharing in convolutional layers ensures translation invariance.

- **Mechanism of Creativity**:
  - Creativity arises from combinatorial mixing of local training set patches.
  - ELS machine generates novel images by assembling local patches in diverse configurations.

- **Analytic Solutions**:
  - Derives minimum mean squared error (MMSE) approximations to the ideal score function under locality and equivariance constraints.
  - Provides simple analytic solutions for boundary-broken equivariant local score.

- **Performance Metrics**:
  - ELS machine predicts outputs with high accuracy: median \( r^2 \) of 0.90, 0.91, 0.94 on CIFAR10, FashionMNIST, and MNIST respectively.

- **Boundary Effects**:
  - Explains how image boundaries influence generation and lead to spatial inconsistencies in outputs.

- **Comparison with Self-Attention Models**:
  - ELS machine partially predicts outputs of UNets with self-attention (median \( r^2 \sim 0.75 \) on CIFAR10).
  - Highlights the role of attention in achieving semantic coherence from local patch mosaics.

- **Theoretical Implications**:
  - Challenges the notion that ideal score learning leads to creativity; instead, creativity stems from the failure to learn the ideal score function.
  - Establishes a foundation for further exploration of attention-enabled diffusion models.

- **Mathematical Framework**:
  - Forward diffusion process transforms data distribution \( \pi_0(\phi) \) into isotropic Gaussian \( N(0, I) \).
  - Reverse flow defined by:
    \[
    -\phi_t = \gamma_t(\phi_t + s_t(\phi_t))
    \]
  - Score function defined as:
    \[
    s_t(\phi) = \frac{1}{1 - \alpha_t} \sum_{\phi' \in D} (\sqrt{\alpha_t} \phi' - \phi) W_t(\phi'|\phi)
    \]

- **Visual Representation**:
  - Diagram illustrating the flow of the reverse diffusion process and the role of local patches in generating new samples (if needed, use mermaid markdown for flowchart).
