  "abstract": "Scaling laws are useful guides for derisking expensive training runs, as they\npredict performance of large models using cheaper, small-scale experiments.\nHowever, there remain gaps between current scaling studies and how language\nmodels are ultimately trained and evaluated. For instance, scaling is usually\nstudied in the compute-optimal training regime (i.e., \"Chinchilla optimal\"\nregime). In contrast, models are often over-trained to reduce inference costs.\nMoreover, scaling laws mostly predict loss on next-token prediction, but models\nare usually compared on downstream task performance. To address both\nshortcomings, we create a testbed of 104 models with 0.011B to 6.9B parameters\ntrained with various numbers of tokens on three data distributions. First, we\nfit scaling laws that extrapolate in both the amount of over-training and the\nnumber of model parameters. This enables us to predict the validation loss of a\n1.4B parameter, 900B token run (i.e., 32$\\times$ over-trained) and a 6.9B\nparameter, 138B token run (i.e., a compute-optimal run)$\\unicode{x2014}$each\nfrom experiments that take 300$\\times$ less compute. Second, we relate the\nperplexity of a language model to its downstream task performance by proposing\na power law. We use this law to predict top-1 error averaged over downstream\ntasks for the two aforementioned models, using experiments that take 20$\\times$\nless compute.
