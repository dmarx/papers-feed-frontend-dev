The decisions made by the researchers in the study of scaling exponents across parameterizations and optimizers are grounded in a combination of theoretical insights, empirical observations, and practical considerations. Below is a detailed technical explanation and rationale for each of the key decisions outlined in your request:

### 1. Decision on the Choice of Parameterizations for Scaling
The choice of parameterizations is critical for ensuring stable training dynamics as model sizes increase. The researchers selected four common parameterizations (Standard, NTK, muP, and MFP) to cover a broad spectrum of scaling behaviors. This diversity allows for a comprehensive analysis of how different parameterizations affect learning rates and model performance. The decision is justified by the need to understand the implications of each parameterization on the stability and efficiency of training across various model sizes.

### 2. Decision on the Selection of Optimizers for Experiments
The selection of three distinct optimizers (SGD, Adam, and Adafactor) was made to represent different scaling regimes. Each optimizer has unique characteristics regarding how they scale updates relative to parameters and gradients. This choice allows the researchers to explore the interplay between parameterization and optimization strategies, providing insights into which combinations yield the best performance under varying conditions.

### 3. Decision to Investigate Alignment Assumptions in Prior Work
The researchers aimed to challenge the existing assumptions about alignment between parameters and data, which were considered overly conservative. By investigating these assumptions, they sought to uncover potential scaling mismatches that could arise from rigid adherence to prior theories. This decision is rooted in the belief that a more nuanced understanding of alignment could lead to improved scaling prescriptions and better model performance.

### 4. Decision to Derive New Theoretical Results Under Weaker Assumptions
By deriving new theoretical results under weaker assumptions, the researchers aimed to broaden the applicability of their findings. This approach allows for a more flexible framework that can accommodate a wider range of scenarios, potentially leading to novel insights and methodologies that were previously overlooked due to stringent assumptions.

### 5. Decision to Implement Per-Layer Learning Rate Prescriptions
The implementation of per-layer learning rate prescriptions was motivated by the observation that different layers may require distinct learning rates to optimize their training effectively. This decision addresses the issue of scaling mismatches that can occur when a single global learning rate is applied, which may not be suitable for all layers. The researchers found that tailored learning rates could significantly enhance model performance.

### 6. Decision to Propose Adam-atan2 for Epsilon Scaling
The proposal of Adam-atan2 was driven by the need to address the issue of epsilon underflow in adaptive optimizers. By eliminating the epsilon hyperparameter entirely, the researchers aimed to create a more numerically stable and scale-invariant version of Adam. This decision reflects a practical consideration for improving the robustness of training, especially in large models where precision issues can have significant impacts.

### 7. Decision to Conduct Extensive Empirical Investigations Across Model Sizes
The extensive empirical investigations were essential to validate theoretical predictions and to understand how scaling behaviors manifest in practice. By training tens of thousands of models across various sizes, the researchers could gather comprehensive data on the performance of different parameterizations and optimizers, leading to more reliable conclusions.

### 8. Decision to Utilize Hyperparameter Transfer Across Scales
The decision to explore hyperparameter transfer was based on the practical need to reduce the computational burden associated with hyperparameter tuning for large models. By demonstrating that hyperparameters optimized for smaller models can be effectively transferred to larger models, the researchers aimed to streamline the training process and make it more efficient.

### 9. Decision to Define Metrics for Measuring Alignment During Training
Defining metrics for measuring alignment was crucial for quantifying the relationship between parameters and data throughout the training process. This decision allows for a systematic investigation of how alignment evolves and its impact on scaling behaviors, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of model training.

### 10. Decision to Explore the Impact of Epsilon Underflow on Performance
The exploration of epsilon underflow was motivated by the recognition that numerical stability is a critical factor in the performance of adaptive optimizers. By investigating this issue, the researchers aimed to identify strategies to mitigate its effects, thereby enhancing the reliability of training in large-scale models.

### 11. Decision to Compare Performance Across Different Parameterizations and Optimizers
Comparing performance across various parameterizations and optimizers was essential to identify the most effective combinations for scaling. This decision reflects a comprehensive approach to understanding the interactions between different components of the training process, leading to more informed recommendations for practitioners.

### 12. Decision to Focus on Stability and Non-Triviality in Parameterization Theory
Focusing on stability and non-triviality in parameterization theory was driven by the need to ensure that models not only learn effectively but also maintain stable training dynamics. This decision underscores the importance of developing parameterizations that facilitate meaningful learning without leading to instability as model sizes increase.

### 13. Decision to Analyze the Relationship Between Parameter Scaling and Update Scales
Analyzing the relationship between parameter scaling and update scales was crucial for
