- **Dataset Overview**: Zyda is a dataset comprising 1.3 trillion tokens, created by integrating major open-source datasets under permissive licenses.
  
- **Key Datasets Included**: 
  - The Pile
  - SlimPajama
  - RefinedWeb
  - C4
  - PeS2o
  - arxiv_s2orc_parsed
  - StarCoder

- **Quality Assurance**: Extensive filtering and deduplication processes were applied to enhance dataset quality, including:
  - Heuristic syntactic filtering to remove low-quality data.
  - Document-level filtering based on syntactic heuristics.

- **Filtering Pipeline**:
  - **Stage 1**: Substring replacement using regex to sanitize formatting issues.
  - **Stage 2**: Document-level filtering categorized into:
    1. Syntactically broken documents
    2. Semantically meaningless documents
    3. Objectionable content

- **Deduplication Method**: Utilized Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) based on MinHash signatures for approximate duplicate identification, with Jaccard similarity thresholds of 40% and 80%.

- **Performance Evaluation**: Models trained on Zyda outperform those trained on Dolma and the Pile, particularly when the StarCoder subset is excluded.

- **Token-to-Parameter Ratio Trends**: Notable increase in training tokens to model parameters ratio in state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g., 12T:132B for DBRX and 15T:8B for Llama3.

- **Chinchilla Scaling Laws**: Emphasize equal scaling of parameters and data for compute-optimal models, while the trend is shifting towards inference-optimal models.

- **Open Access**: Zyda is available on Hugging Face and the processing code is open-source on GitHub.

- **Filtering Results**: 
  - RefinedWeb: 2.21% filtered
  - SlimPajama: 3.56% filtered
  - C4-EN: 1.16% filtered
  - Pile-Uncopyrighted: 12.17% filtered
  - peS2o: 0.11% filtered
  - arXiv: 11.33% filtered

- **Deduplication Process**: 
  - MinHash(A) and MinHash(B) used to compute resemblance based on n-grams.
  - Deduplication performed both within and across datasets.
