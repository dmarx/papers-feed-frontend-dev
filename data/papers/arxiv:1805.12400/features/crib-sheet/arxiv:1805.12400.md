- **Phylogenetic Trees**: Fundamental representation of evolutionary processes; modeled as acyclic connected graphs \( T = (V, E) \) with \( N \) labeled leaves.
  
- **Tree Metrics**: A distance matrix \( W \) represents a phylogenetic tree if it satisfies the four-point condition:
  \[
  w_{ij} + w_{k\ell} \leq \max(w_{ik} + w_{j\ell}, w_{i\ell} + w_{jk}) \quad \forall i, j, k, \ell
  \]

- **Ultrametric Trees**: A phylogenetic tree is ultrametric if it satisfies the three-point condition:
  \[
  w(i, k) \leq \max(w(i, j), w(j, k)) \quad \forall i, j, k
  \]

- **BHV Tree Space**: The geometry of phylogenetic trees characterized by unique geodesics; significant for computational and statistical analysis.

- **Tropical Geometry**: A mathematical framework that alleviates complications of non-Euclidean tree space; enables descriptive and inferential statistics.

- **Tropical Metric**: Defined on the tropical projective torus; allows for well-defined probabilistic and parametric statistical questions.

- **Statistical Techniques**: 
  - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Descriptive statistical task applied in tropical tree space.
  - **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**: Inferential statistical task applied in tropical tree space.

- **Computational Efficiency**: Tropical geometric approach shows improved performance over BHV space in real data applications (e.g., seasonal influenza).

- **Generalized Hilbert Projective Metric**: Endows tropical geometric phylogenetic tree space with desirable analytic, geometric, and topological properties.

- **Real Data Application**: Demonstrated improvements in statistical performance using tropical geometry in phylogenetic analysis.

- **Future Research Directions**: Potential for further development of parametric studies in tropical geometric settings for phylogenetic trees.
