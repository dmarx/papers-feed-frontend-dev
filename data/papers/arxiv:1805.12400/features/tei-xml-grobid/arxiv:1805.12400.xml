<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Phylogenetic trees are the fundamental mathematical representation of evolutionary processes in biology. They are also objects of interest in pure mathematics, such as algebraic geometry and combinatorics, due to their discrete geometry. Although they are important data structures, they face the significant challenge that sets of trees form a non-Euclidean phylogenetic tree space, which means that standard computational and statistical methods cannot be directly applied. In this work, we explore the statistical feasibility of a pure mathematical representation of the set of all phylogenetic trees based on tropical geometry for both descriptive and inferential statistics, and unsupervised and supervised machine learning. Our exploration is both theoretical and practical. We show that the tropical geometric phylogenetic tree space endowed with a generalized Hilbert projective metric exhibits analytic, geometric, and topological properties that are desirable for theoretical studies in probability and statistics and allow for well-defined questions to be posed. We illustrate the statistical feasibility of the tropical geometric perspective for phylogenetic trees with an example of both a descriptive and inferential statistical task. Moreover, this approach exhibits increased computational efficiency and statistical performance over the current state-of-the-art, which we illustrate with a real data example on seasonal influenza. Our results demonstrate the viability of the tropical geometric setting for parametric statistical and probabilistic studies of sets of phylogenetic trees.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Evolutionary relationships describing how organisms are related by a common ancestor are represented in a branching diagram known as a phylogenetic tree. Phylogenetic trees model many important and diverse biological phenomena, such as speciation, the spread of pathogens, and cancer evolution. Methodology to analyze phylogenetic datasets has been under active research for several decades for two important reasons. First, explicit computations directly on collections of phylogenetic trees are challenging due to high dimensionality in terms of a large number of leaves, a long evolutionary history, and an intricate branching pattern. Second, standard statistical methodologies are not directly applicable due to the non-Euclidean nature of the trees themselves as well as the set that they make up. Significant previous work addresses various classical statistical interests, however a fundamental breakthrough for quantitative studies on sets of trees emerged through studying the geometry of the set of all phylogenetic trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Billera et al., 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Referred to in the literature as BHV tree space-after the authors Billera, Holmes, and Vogtmannthe set of all phylogenetic trees is studied in a setting where each tree is represented as an individual point. The geometry is characterized by a unique geodesic between any two points; its length defines a metric on the space. Since its introduction in 2001, it has been actively studied in various wide-reaching domains, including algebraic geometry (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Devadoss and Morava, 2015)</ref>, category theory (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Baez and Otter, 2017)</ref>, computational biology (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Weyenberg and Yoshida, 2016)</ref>, and statistical genetics (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Nye et al., 2017)</ref>. Despite its indisputable significance, the BHV geometry nevertheless poses significant dataanalytic complications for both descriptive and inferential statistics and unsupervised and supervised machine learning. Although the non-Euclidean aspect of tree space cannot be avoided, considering an alternative approach from pure mathematics based on tropical geometry-a variant of algebraic geometry-alleviates some of these complications and is a promising alternative approach for probability-based statistics on sets of phylogenetic trees. The first formal connection between tropical geometry and mathematical phylogenetics arises in the space of phylogenetic trees in relation to a particular tropical algebraic variety <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Speyer and Sturmfels, 2004)</ref>. This coincidence has been further studied in theoretical research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Ardila and Klivans, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Manon, 2011)</ref>, however, its implication and potential in applied work remain largely understudied and untapped.</p><p>In this paper, we explore the tropical geometric perspective of phylogenetic tree space with the aim of enabling descriptive and inferential statistics as well as unsupervised and supervised machine learning. Specifically, we study the subspace of the tropical projective torus corresponding to the space of phylogenetic trees equipped with a generalized projective Hilbert metric, which we refer to as the tropical metric. We refer to this metric space as palm tree space (tropical tree space) and show that it satisfies fundamental assumptions to ensure that probabilistic and parametric statistical questions are valid and well-defined, which establishes the grounds for future development of parametric studies in the tropical geometric setting for phylogenetic trees. We give a concrete example of both a descriptive and inferential task in statistics: principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), respectively. We study these tasks in the context of both simulated and real-world seasonal influenza data. Our real data application demonstrates that the tropical geometric approach exhibits improvements in computational efficiency and improved statistical performance over the BHV setting.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide background and motivation for our study. In Section 3, we discuss properties of the tropical metric on the space of phylogenetic trees and formally define palm tree space. We study its geometry, topology, and analytic properties in relation to BHV space. We also give some examples of theoretical probability measures used in statistics and that are important in probability theory. In Section 4, we give examples of statistical techniques on palm tree space, including numerical experiments and an application to real data in both palm tree and BHV space. We close in Section 5 with a discussion, and some directions for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background and Motivation</head><p>Phylogenetic trees are symbolic objects that model evolutionary divergence from a common ancestor. In computational biology, the reconstruction of a phylogenetic tree from an input of sequence alignment data (e.g., DNA and RNA) is a challenging problem; reconstruction methods are known to be highly sensitive to the input sequences (different genes or coding regions will give rise to different trees), measurement errors (alignment or sequencing errors), and noise typical to this type of biological data (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Leaché and Rannala, 2010)</ref>. This sensitivity naturally invites the question of how to compare trees, for example, arising from different reconstruction methods. Mathematically, comparing objects entails measuring the distance between them; in the context of phylogenetic trees, this gives rise to a tree space equipped with a metric between trees. One of the most significant challenges in computational work with phylogenetic trees as data objects is that their graphical structure gives rise to a non-Euclidean tree space.</p><p>In this section, we provide the mathematical background to phylogenetic trees from the pure mathematical perspective and the statistical motivation for studying this perspective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Defining Phylogenetic Trees</head><p>In what follows, we consider N ∈ N. A tree is an acyclic connected graph T = (V, E), defined by a set of vertices V and a set of edges E. An N -tree is a tree with N labeled terminal nodes called leaves. Edges connecting to leaves are called external edges, other edges are called internal edges. A binary N -tree is an N -tree with the following conditions on the degree of a vertex v ∈ V : if deg(v) = 2, then v is the root of the tree and it is unique; if deg(v) = 1, then v is a leaf; and if deg(v) = 3, then v is an internal vertex. A tree topology is the "shape" of the tree; it is a branching configuration of edges together with a leaf labelling scheme. There are (2N -3)!! binary tree topologies on N leaves <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Schröder, 1870)</ref>. A metric N -tree is a tree with zero or positive lengths on all edges; metric N -trees are also known as phylogenetic trees. We denote the space of phylogenetic trees with N leaves by T N .</p><p>A phylogenetic tree may be represented by all pairwise distances between leaves. Let w ij denote the distance between leaves i and j, given by the sums of edge lengths along the unique path between i and j. The N × N matrix W with entries w ij then represents a phylogenetic tree. Since W is symmetric with zeros along the diagonal, the upper-triangular portion of the matrix contains all of the unique information needed to specify a phylogenetic tree in terms of its pairwise distances. Thus W represents a phylogenetic tree as, in essence, a distance matrix. However, in order for the distance matrix W to represent a phylogenetic tree, the following additional condition must be satisfied.</p><p>Proposition 1. (Four-Point Condition <ref type="bibr">(Buneman, 1974, Theorem 1)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">(Maclagan and Sturmfels, 2015, Lemma 4.3.6)</ref>). A distance matrix W represents a phylogenetic tree if it satisfies the conditions to be a metric and the maximum among the following Plücker relations is attained at least twice for 1 ≤ i &lt; j &lt; k &lt; ℓ ≤ N :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">w ij + w kℓ , w ik + w jℓ , w iℓ + w jk ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>or equivalently, that</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">w ij + w kℓ ≤ max(w ik + w jℓ , w iℓ + w jk ) (2)</formula><p>for all i, j, k, ℓ ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N }.</p><p>A distance matrix W satisfying the conditions of Proposition 1 is known as a tree metric. Note that tree metrics represent phylogenetic trees; these differ from metrics between trees. For W representing a phylogenetic tree (that is, satisfying the conditions in Proposition 1), we may also represent the upper triangular portion of the matrix in vector form by setting n := N 2 and defining the following map:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">W : T N → R n , W → w = (w 12 , w 13 , . . . , w 1N , w 23 , . . . , w 2N , . . . , w (N -1)N ),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where the entries are ordered lexicographically.</p><p>Example 2. The tree metric w ∈ R 6 for the tree in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> expressed as a vector is (w P Q , w P R , w P S , w QR , w QS , w RS ). As a matrix W , it is</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">    0 w P Q w P R w P S 0 w QR w QS 0 w RS 0     =     0 a + b a + c + d a + c + e 0 b + c + d b + c + e 0 d + e 0     .</formula><p>The Plücker relations (1) associated with W are The four-point condition for trees may be further tightened to give rise to an important subclass of trees as follows.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">A := w P Q + w RS = a + b + d + e, B := w QR + w P S = a + b + 2c + d + e, C := w P R + w QS = a + b + 2c + d + e. Since P &lt; Q &lt; R &lt; S,</formula><p>Proposition 3 (Three-Point Condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Jardine et al., 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Maclagan and Sturmfels, 2015)</ref>). A distance matrix W represents an ultrametric tree if it satisfies the conditions to be a tree metric and the maximum among w(i, j), w(i, k), w(j, k) is achieved at least twice for 1 ≤ i &lt; j &lt; k ≤ N , or equivalently, that w(i, k) ≤ max(w(i, j), w(j, k)) for all i, j, k ∈</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">[N ].</formula><p>Denote the space of all phylogenetic trees satisfying the three-point condition with N leaves by U N . Ultrametric trees are also equidistant trees; i.e., rooted trees where the distance from the root to every leaf is equal. Proposition 4. A phylogenetic tree T is an ultrametric tree if and only if T is equidistant.</p><p>Proof. For any two points X, Y on a tree, we denote by w(X, Y ) the length of the unique path connecting X and Y . Suppose a tree T is equidistant with root R. Then for any three leaves A, B, C, we have that w(R, A) = w(R, B) = w(R, C). Since R, A, B, C satisfies the four-point condition, the maximum among (1), w(R, A)+w(B, C), w(R, B)+w(A, C), and w(R, C)+w(A, B) is attained at least twice. Thus, the maximum among w(B, C), w(A, C), w(A, B) is also attained at least twice, satisfying the three-point condition, and T is therefore an ultrametric.</p><p>Conversely, suppose T is an ultrametric. Then there are finitely many leaves in T , so we can choose a pair of leaves A, B such that w(A, B) is maximal among all such pairs. Along the unique path from A to B, there is a unique point R such that w(R, A) = w(R, B). For any other leaf C, consider the distance w(R, C): Since the paths from R to A and B only intersect at R, the path from R to C intersects at least one of them only at R. Suppose without loss of generality that the path from R to A is such a path. Then</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">w(A, C) = w(R, A)+w(R, C). Since w(A, C) ≤ w(A, B), we have w(R, C) ≤ w(R, B). If w(R, C) &lt; w(R, B), then w(A, C) &lt; w(R, A) + w(R, B) = 2w(R, B), and w(B, C) ≤ w(R, B) + w(R, C) &lt; 2w(R, B), so the maximum among w(A, B), w(A, C), w(B, C) is w(A, C) = 2w(R, B)</formula><p>and it is only attained once -a contradiction, since T was assumed an ultrametric. Hence w(R, C) = w(R, B), and R has equal distance to all leaves of T . Therefore T is equidistant with root R.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Metrics on Tree Spaces: BHV Space</head><p>Various metrics between trees have been derived in biology. A notable class of metrics strives to retain the inner product property akin to Euclidean distance, which makes them popular due to their integrability into a wide range of statistical approaches, such as functional and nonparametric modeling. One metric from this class extensively used in biology is the Robinson-Foulds metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Robinson and Foulds, 1981)</ref>. This metric (and other inner-product distances between trees) is known to suffer from structural and interpretive errors. For example, many pairs of trees measure the same distance apart; also, large distances between trees, counterintuitively, do not necessarily indicate a disparity in ancestral heritage <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Steel and Penny, 1993)</ref>. Other commonly-occurring distances include the nearest neighbor interchange metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Waterman et al., 1976)</ref>, subtree transfer distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Allen and Steel, 2001)</ref>, and variational distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Steel and Székely, 2006)</ref>. For a detailed review of metrics between trees, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Weyenberg and Yoshida (2016)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">St. John (2016)</ref>. A pioneering approach that bypasses difficulties and limitations of these metrics focuses on the geometry of tree space <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Billera et al., 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Specifically, the space of phylogenetic trees is modeled as a moduli space, where each point in the space represents a phylogenetic tree. Trees are expressed only by the lengths of their internal edges, which are recorded as entries in a vector of dimension N -2 since in a binary tree with N leaves, there are at most N -2 internal edges; see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> for an illustration. External edges are not considered, since taking them into account does not affect the geometry of the space: including external edges simply amounts to taking the product of tree space with an N -dimensional Euclidean space. A nonnegative Euclidean orthant R N -2 ≥0 is associated to each tree topology. BHV space may also be interpreted combinatorially: For each orthant, the link of the origin</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">L N := (x 1 , . . . , x N -2 ) | i x i = 1 (4)</formula><p>gives rise to a simplicial complex of dimension N -3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Billera et al., 2001)</ref>. BHV space is an infinite cone over L N . The (2N -3)!! orthants are grafted at right-angles to make up the tree space, which gives rise to a property of nonpositive curvature known as CAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(0)</ref>. In CAT(0) spaces, there is a unique shortest path between any two points; here, this is the BHV geodesic. To compute BHV geodesics, first, the geodesic distance between two trees (represented by only internal edge lengths as in the original reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Billera et al., 2001)</ref>) is computed, and then the external branch lengths are factored in to compute the overall geodesic distance between two trees in full generality (where external branch lengths are included, as opposed to the original reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Billera et al., 2001)</ref>), by taking the differences between external branch lengths. Since each orthant is locally viewed as a Euclidean space, the shortest path between two points within a single orthant is a straight Euclidean line. The difficulty appears in establishing which sequence of orthants joining the two topologies contains the geodesic. In the case of four leaves, this can be readily determined using a systematic grid search, but such a search is intractable with larger trees. Currently, the fastest available algorithm to compute geodesic paths between any two points in this tree space has a time complexity of O(N 4 ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Owen and Provan, 2011)</ref>. The length structure of the BHV geodesic induces the BHV metric d BHV on this space. This setup has come to be known as BHV space T BHV N and is ubiquitous even in non-biological fields, including computer vision, combinatorics, and category theory. It has also been proposed as the definitive setting for computational studies on sets of phylogenetic trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Gavryushkin and Drummond, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>It turns out that BHV space poses considerable limitations for classical descriptive and inferential statistics. On the descriptive front, the convex hull of finitely many points in tree space with edges given by BHV geodesics is unbounded in dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lin et al., 2017)</ref>, so there exists no obvious subspace for projections and no lower dimensional representations of data. This is restrictive for classical dimensionality reduction and data visualization methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA). An important challenge in inferential statistics in BHV space concerns the Fréchet mean, which is a fundamental quantity in statistics: the Fréchet mean is the generalization of the classical arithmetic mean to arbitrary metric spaces; see also Section 3.5.1 further on. In BHV space, Fréchet means are sticky: the mean fails to be injective and "sticks" to lower dimensional strata <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hotz et al., 2013)</ref>; see Example 5. Thus, perturbing points in a sample results in no change in the mean, meaning that exact parametric asymptotic results cannot be derived, which prohibits classical exact statistical inference.</p><p>Example 5. In Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, we position three unit masses on the 3-spider as shown below, which is the stratified space of three R ≥0 rays joined at the origin. Two of the masses are at distance 1 from the origin, while the remaining mass is at distance a from the origin. This is precisely the BHV space of phylogenetic trees with three leaves and fixed external edge lengths. The position x of the barycenter (Fréchet mean) is calculated by minimizing 2(1 + x) 2 + (a -x) 2 . The solution is x = 0 for a &lt; 2, and x = (a -2)/3 for a ≥ 2. The Fréchet mean tends to stick to lower-dimensional strata.</p><p>Sophisticated methods have been developed to bypass these difficulties: a locus of BHV Fréchet means has well-behaved dimensionality and serves as a suitable lower dimensional projective space (Nye et al., 2017), and a central limit theorem for BHV Fréchet means exists via a generalized delta method <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Barden et al., 2018)</ref>. Inferential techniques have also been proposed based on this generalized delta method strategy (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Willis, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Willis and Bell, 2018)</ref>. These, and other proposed methods, are largely approximate, rather than exact statistical methods; additionally, they tend to be nonparametric, rather than parametric. These statistical challenges have spurred recent proposals of alternative tree spaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Garba et al., 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Tropical Geometry and Phylogenetic Tree Space</head><p>In this work, we focus on the appearance of phylogenetic tree space in tropical geometry in groundbreaking work that formally connects the space of phylogenetic trees and the tropical Grassmannian <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Speyer and Sturmfels, 2004)</ref>. We now outline the connection between tropical geometry and phylogenetic tree space.</p><p>To do this, we return to the map W (3). Specifically, we would like to understand what the image of W is: if it is a linear space, then theory from linear algebra is applicable; if it is a manifold, then principles of Riemannian geometry may be applied. It turns out that the image of W is tropical geometric, so new tools for statistics are needed.</p><p>To see this, notice that the embedding (3) of trees into Euclidean space may be refined: if we do not wish to distinguish between phylogenetic trees differing by a constant on each external edge, we may consider the quotient space R n /R1, where 1 is the all-one vector (1, 1, . . . , 1), which gives a reduction in dimension. The quotient space R n /R1 is known as the tropical projective torus and it is generated by an equivalence relation ∼ specifying that for two points x, y ∈ R n , x ∼ y if and only if all coordinates of their difference x -y are equal. In the context of trees, the quotient normalizes evolutionary time between trees. The tropical projective torus is the ambient space of the space of phylogenetic trees; T N is a proper subset of R n /R1. The tropical projective torus R n /R1 may also be generated by a group action: Let G := {(c, c, . . . , c) ∈ R n | c ∈ R} with coordinate-wise addition, then G is an additive group. G acts on R n as follows: for g ∈ G and x ∈ R,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">g • x = (x 1 + g 1 , x 2 + g 2 , . . . , x n + g n ).</formula><p>Each point in R n /R1 is then exactly one orbit under the group action of G on R n .</p><p>Furthermore, if we disregard differences on external edges, we may consider the quotient space R n / im(ϕ) where the map ϕ : R N → R n is given by ϕ(x 1 , . . . , x N ) = (x 1 + x 2 , x 1 + x 3 , . . . , x N -1 + x N ). This map has the geometric intuition that two trees are identified if the lengths of the N edges adjacent to the leaves are the only difference between them, which gives intuition on why this map is well-defined; for further technical details on why this map is well-defined, please see page 396 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Speyer and Sturmfels (2004)</ref>. We thus obtain the following sequence of maps:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">T N -1 → R n → R n /R1 → R n / im(ϕ).</formula><p>(5)</p><p>In algebraic geometry, the solution sets of systems of polynomial equations-referred to as algebraic varieties-are studied. In tropical geometry, these polynomial equations are defined in the tropical semiring, (R ∪ {∞}, ⊕, ) where a ⊕ b := min(a, b) and a b := a + b. Tropical mathematics involves studying various mathematical objects and problems which are defined using these operations. For example, let a N denote the tropical product of a with itself N times; let A ⊂ N N . Tropical polynomials are piecewise linear functions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">f (x 1 , . . . , x N ) = a∈A c a x a1 1 • • • x a N N = min a∈A (c a + a 1 x 1 + • • • + a N x N ).</formula><p>A tropical hypersurface H(f ) is the set of all (x 1 , . . . , x N ) ∈ R N where f is attained at least twice as a runs over A.  <ref type="table">G 2,4 , G 2,4 ,  G 2,4 ,</ref> and <ref type="table">G 2,4 under (5).

A finite tropical Borel measure on T N is a map µ : B(T N ) → [0, ∞) such that µ(∅) = 0, and for mutually disjoint Borel sets Alternatively, the existence of probability measures on T N can be seen by considering an arbitrary probability space (Ω, F, P) together with a measurable map X : Ω → T N . Such maps exist, since we have shown in Section 3 that T N is a Polish space and thus (T N , B(T N )) is a standard measurable space (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Taylor (2012)</ref>). The probability space (Ω, F, P) is a measure space by assumption, thus also measurable. In this case, the map X is a random variable taking values in T N .

Here, we focus on HA, which tends to be the most variable protein in genomic evolution, in terms of changing the antigenic make-up of surface proteins. Such antigenic variability (known as antigenic drift) is an important driving factor behind vaccine failure. We restrict our study to the subtype H3N2, which is becoming increasingly abundant, and a dominant factor studied in developing flu vaccines due to its recently increasing resistance to standard antiviral drugs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Altman, 2006)</ref>.

Genomic data for 1089 full length sequences of hemagglutinin (HA) for influenza A H3N2 from 1993 to 2017 in the state of New York were obtained from the GI-SAID EpiFlu TM database (<ref type="url" target="www.gisaid.org">www.gisaid.org</ref>) and aligned with muscle <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Edgar, 2004</ref>) using default settings. HA sequences from each season were related to those of the preceding season. We then applied tree dimensionality reduction Zairis et al. ( <ref type="formula">2016</ref>) using temporal windows of 5 consecutive seasons to create 21 datasets: The influenza virus is assumed to emerge and evolve from a common ancestor: although the virus mutates each season and within each patient, each of these seasonal and patient-specific mutations can be traced back to a single virus (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Liu et al., 2009)</ref>. This evolutionary pattern is depicted in a large phylogenetic tree. Tree dimensionality reduction produces a collection of smaller trees that faithfully represents the evolutionary behavior of the single large tree, and thus allows the evolutionary information to be treated as a dataset with multiple points akin to bootstrapping, rather than viewing the large tree as a single datum <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Zairis et al., 2016)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3">Interpretation of Tree PCA</head><p>In the tropical case, the second principal component represented by the tropical triangle-whose vertices are given by three ultrametric trees, and whose edges are given by the tropical line segments between them-divides into cells, which are determined by the tree topologies that an edge (tropical line segment) traverses. Trees in the dataset are then projected into the cells corresponding to their topologies in the PCA visualization. The simplest case in both BHV and tropical PCA is where all three vertices of the triangle are of the same tree topology, then there will only be one cell and all projections will be of the same topology; if two points are trees of the same tree topology, then every point on the tropical line segment connecting them will also be of the same tree topology. An example can be seen in the 1993 data set, available at <ref type="url" target="https://github.com/antheamonod/FluPCA/Figures">https://github.com/antheamonod/FluPCA/Figures</ref>.  The BHV locus, which represents the second principal component in BHV space, is also generated by three vertices (ultrametric trees), and depicted in the BHV PCA plots by a triangle. Here, varying tree topologies are depicted by the multicolored patches within the triangular region, indicating that the locus straddles several orthants in BHV space. In the 2008 dataset in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>, the locus straddles two BHV orthants and we see two tree topologies occurring among the projected points.</p><p>In the 2008 dataset, palm tree space and the tropical geometric approach to computations in phylogenetic tree space appears to allow for occurrences of richer and more subtle structures and methods: in these examples, we see tropical PCA projections of six different topologies, versus two in the BHV case.</p></div>

We have also shown that it is a setting amenable to rigorous treatments and studies in probability.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biological and Statistical Implications</head><p>Despite the statistical challenges of arbitrariness of dimension of BHV polytopes and stickiness which affect descriptive and inferential statistics, the BHV parameterization has been successfully implemented to reveal important biological findings (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Zairis et al. (2014)</ref>). In terms of interpretation, the unresolved singularities of BHV Fréchet means translate to "indecisiveness" of which branching patterns or tree topologies are "preferred," which is consistent with what is often seen in some biological settings where the trees arise from sequence alignment. However, mathematically, trees are used to model other biological phenomena, such as pulmonary paths as airway trees (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Feragen et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Feragen et al., , 2015))</ref>; brain growth and structure (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Yan and Yan, 2013)</ref>; and neuronal morphologies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Kanari et al., 2018)</ref>. Such a probabilistic assumption may not be reasonable in these other settings. Given recent research interest in developing methods to bypass these difficulties support the goal of our work, which is that exploring alternative representations is an important research direction (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Anaya et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Skwerer et al., 2018)</ref>. An important and interesting direction for future research is the identification of non-uniform probability distributions in the tropical setting, which is challenging yet promising; various ways in which tropical Gaussian distributions may be constructed have been previously outlined <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Tran, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>In the context of shape statistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kendall, 1989</ref>) and computational anatomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Grenander and Miller, 1998)</ref>, the data objects of interest are often modeled as elements of algebraic spaces. In particular, these algebraic spaces are quotient spaces generated by group actions. Recent work has studied the behavior of estimators on such spaces, uncovering undesirable properties, such as biasedness and inconsistency when the group actions are random (that is, when the quotient spaces are generated by elements of the group are chosen at random to act on the topological space) or continuous (as in the case of Lie groups acting on Riemannian manifolds) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Devilliers et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Miolane and Pennec, 2015)</ref>. Nonparametric methods have been developed to bypass the problem of inconsistency <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bhattacharya and Patrangenaru, 2014)</ref>. As previously mentioned, the tropical projective torus R n /R1 is a quotient space that may be generated by a group action, however the biasedness and inconsistency in previous work arise due to the poor behavior of the transformed metric after it is mapped into the quotient space, which results in a pseudometric. In our case, the tropical metric is well-behaved and defined directly on the quotient space, therefore differing in setting to previous work.</p><p>It should also be noted that the non-uniqueness property of geodesics in palm tree space poses computational difficulties, but does not prohibit statistical analysis and can still yield useful descriptive as well as inferential information, for example, on clustering behavior. Another important setting where geodesics are not unique is that of positively-curved spaces. The asymptotic behavior and distributions on Riemannian manifolds, including positively curved manifolds, has been studied in existing work <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bhattacharya and Bhattacharya, 2008)</ref>. Recent work develops techniques for data analysis on curved spaces by tuning the geodesic metrics accordingly <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Kobayashi and Wynn, 2019)</ref>. In particular, a general Fréchet function is defined, and its parameters are chosen accordingly, depending on the goal: for example, one geodesic metric may be transformed into another to control the curvature of the space for data analysis. There are large bodies of existing work in related areas on curved spaces, for example, in the case of manifold learning; shape statistics; Wasserstein spaces for probability measures; and information geometry. Though these domains each have their own specific goals and studies, data analysis and computation play a central role in these settings. Moreover, there are known settings in these related areas where positive curvature, and thus non-uniqueness of geodesics, arises (for example, the 2-Wasserstein space for Gaussian measures is positively curved <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Takatsu, 2011)</ref>). Adapting existing techniques in these settings to statistical analysis in palm tree space is an important direction of research that merits exploration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future Work</head><p>Our work invites the reinterpretation of existing statistical methods in terms of the tropical metric to make a wider array of exact analyses readily available and interpretable to phylogenetic research with potential impact for biological discoveries. Two important directions for future work include the search for explicit parametric probability distributions in order to reinterpret classical probability-based statistical approaches on sets of phylogenetic trees, based on, for example, the classical central limit theorem. Another is the formal definition and computation of tropical Fréchet means and a study of the extent of its stickiness. Finally, a complete and systematic comparative study between palm tree and BHV space would be an interesting study to conduct.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Example of an unrooted phylogenetic tree to illustrate the four-point condition.</figDesc></figure>
