Here are detailed technical explanations and justifications for the researchers' decisions regarding the use of tropical geometry in modeling phylogenetic tree space, as well as the various methodological choices made throughout the study:

### Decision to Use Tropical Geometry for Modeling Phylogenetic Tree Space
Tropical geometry provides a combinatorial and piecewise-linear framework that is particularly well-suited for studying the geometry of phylogenetic trees. The decision to use tropical geometry stems from its ability to simplify complex algebraic structures into more manageable forms, allowing for the exploration of tree space properties without the computational burdens associated with traditional methods. Tropical geometry also offers a natural way to handle the non-Euclidean nature of tree space, making it a compelling alternative to classical approaches.

### Choice of Generalized Hilbert Projective Metric for Tropical Tree Space
The generalized Hilbert projective metric is chosen for its desirable properties in measuring distances in non-Euclidean spaces. This metric allows for the definition of a meaningful distance between trees in tropical tree space, preserving the geometric structure necessary for statistical analysis. Its properties ensure that the metric space is complete and that geodesics can be computed, which are essential for both theoretical and practical applications in statistics.

### Adoption of Palm Tree Space Terminology
The term "palm tree space" is adopted to create a distinct identity for the tropical geometric framework applied to phylogenetic trees. This terminology emphasizes the unique characteristics of the tropical metric and helps differentiate it from existing tree space models, such as BHV space. The name also evokes the imagery of tropical trees, aligning with the mathematical concepts being explored.

### Selection of Statistical Techniques (PCA and LDA) for Analysis
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) are selected due to their effectiveness in reducing dimensionality and classifying data, respectively. PCA is useful for identifying the main axes of variation in the data, while LDA focuses on maximizing the separation between different classes. These techniques are well-established in statistical analysis and provide a robust framework for exploring the properties of tropical tree space.

### Decision to Focus on Both Descriptive and Inferential Statistics
Focusing on both descriptive and inferential statistics allows for a comprehensive analysis of the data. Descriptive statistics provide insights into the characteristics of the data, while inferential statistics enable the researchers to make broader conclusions and predictions based on the sample. This dual approach enhances the overall validity and applicability of the findings.

### Use of Simulated vs. Real-World Data for Validation
The decision to use both simulated and real-world data serves to validate the proposed methods under controlled conditions and in practical scenarios. Simulated data allows for the testing of theoretical properties and assumptions, while real-world data demonstrates the applicability and effectiveness of the tropical geometric approach in actual biological contexts, such as seasonal influenza.

### Choice of Metrics for Comparison with BHV Space
Metrics are chosen based on their ability to capture the geometric and topological properties of tree space. The comparison with BHV space is essential to highlight the advantages of the tropical geometric approach, particularly in terms of computational efficiency and statistical performance. By selecting metrics that are commonly used in the literature, the researchers can effectively contextualize their findings within the existing body of work.

### Decision to Explore Computational Efficiency Improvements
The exploration of computational efficiency improvements is motivated by the need to handle large datasets typical in phylogenetic analysis. By focusing on computational efficiency, the researchers aim to make their methods more accessible and practical for real-world applications, addressing a significant barrier in the analysis of phylogenetic trees.

### Assumptions Regarding the Properties of Tropical Metrics
The researchers make specific assumptions about the properties of tropical metrics, such as completeness and the existence of geodesics, to ensure that the statistical methods developed are valid. These assumptions are grounded in the mathematical foundations of tropical geometry and are critical for establishing the theoretical underpinnings of the study.

### Choice of Software/Tools for Numerical Experiments
The choice of software and tools for numerical experiments is guided by their ability to efficiently handle the computations required for tropical metrics and statistical analyses. The researchers likely selected tools that are widely used in the field, ensuring reproducibility and facilitating collaboration with other researchers.

### Decision to Include Theoretical Background in the Introduction
Including theoretical background in the introduction provides readers with the necessary context to understand the significance of the research. It establishes the foundational concepts of tropical geometry and phylogenetic trees, allowing for a clearer interpretation of the results and methodologies presented later in the paper.

### Selection of Specific Phylogenetic Tree Representations (e.g., Distance Matrices)
The selection of specific representations, such as distance matrices, is based on their ability to succinctly capture the essential information about phylogenetic trees. Distance matrices are a common representation in phylogenetics, making them a natural choice for the analysis and comparison of tree structures.

### Decision to Address Challenges of Non-Euclidean Tree Space
Addressing the challenges posed by the non-Euclidean nature of tree space is crucial for the validity of statistical analyses. By acknowledging these challenges, the
