<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Organizing things hierarchically is a natural aspect of human activity. Walking into a large department store, one might first find the men's section, followed by men's casual, and then see the t-shirts hanging along the wall. Or being hungry, one might choose to eat Italian food, decide whether to spring for the better, more authentic version or go to one of the cheaper chain options, and then end up at the Olive Garden. Similarly with data analysis, a hierarchical tree-structured representation of data can provide an illuminating means for understanding and reasoning about the information it contains.</p><p>In this paper, we focus on developing hierarchical topic models to construct tree-structured representations for text data. Hierarchical topic models use a structured prior on the topics underlying a corpus of documents, with the aim of bringing more order to an unstructured set of thematic concepts <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>[2] <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. They do this by learning a tree structure for the underlying topics, with the inferential goal being that topics closer to the root are more general, and gradually become more specific in thematic content when following a path down the tree.</p><p>Our work builds on the nested Chinese restaurant process (nCRP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The nCRP is a Bayesian nonparametric prior for hierarchical topic models, but is limited in that it assumes each document selects topics from one path in the tree. We illustrate this limitation in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. This assumption has practical drawbacks; for trees truncated to a small number of levels this does not allow for many topics per document, and for trees of many levels there are too many nodes to infer.</p><p>The nCRP also has drawbacks from a modeling standpoint. As a simple example, consider an article on ESPN.com about an injured player, compared with an • John Paisley is with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY.</p><p>• Chong Wang is with Voleon Capital Management, Berkeley, CA.</p><p>• David M. Blei is with the Department of Computer Science, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ</p><p>• Michael I. Jordan is with the Departments of EECS and Statistics, UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA article in a sports medicine journal about a specific type of athletic injury. Both documents will contain words about medicine and words about sports. These areas are different enough, however, that one cannot be considered to be a subset of the other. Yet the single-path structure of the nCRP will require this to be the case in order to model the relevant words in the documents, or it will learn a new "sports/medicine" topic rather than a mixture of separate sports and medicine topics. Continuing this analogy, other documents may only be about sports or medicine. As a result, medical terms in the nCRP will need to appear in multiple places within the tree: in its own subtree separate from sports, and also affiliated with sports, perhaps as a child of the general sports topic (in the case of the ESPN article). A similar fractionation of sports-related terms results from the sports medicine article, where the medical terms dominate and sports can be considered a topic underneath the main medicine topic. The result is a tree where topics appear in multiple places, and so the full statistical power within the corpus is not being used to model each topic; the tree will not be as compact as it could be.</p><p>Though the nCRP is a Bayesian nonparametric prior, it performs nonparametric clustering of document-specific paths, which reduces the number of topics available to a document by restricting them to lie on a single path, leading to drawbacks as illustrated above. Our goal is to develop a related Bayesian nonparametric prior that performs word-specific path clustering. We illustrate this objective in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. In this case, each word has access to the entire tree, but with document-specific distributions on the paths within the tree. To this end, we make use of the hierarchical Dirichlet process <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, developing a novel prior that we refer to as the nested hierarchical Dirichlet process (nHDP). The HDP can be viewed as a nonparametric elaboration of the classical topic model, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, providing a mechanism whereby a global Dirichlet process defines a base distribution for a collection of local Dirichlet processes, one for each document. With the nHDP, we extend this arXiv:1210.6738v4 [stat.ML] 2 May 2014 nCRP nHDP Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. An example of path structures for the nested Chinese restaurant process (nCRP) and the nested hierarchical Dirichlet process (nHDP) for hierarchical topic modeling. With the nCRP, the topics for a document are restricted to lying along a single path. With the nHDP, each document has access to the entire tree, but a document-specific distribution on paths will place high probability on a particular subtree. In both models a word follows a path to its topic. This path is deterministic in the case of the nCRP, and drawn from a highly probable document-specific subset of paths in the case of the nHDP.</p><p>idea by letting a global nCRP become a base distribution for a collection of local nCRPs, one for each document. As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the nested HDP provides the opportunity for cross-thematic borrowing while keeping general topic areas in separate subtrees, which is not possible with the nCRP.</p><p>Hierarchical topic models have thus far been applied to corpora of small size. A significant issue, not just with topic models but with Bayesian models in general, is to scale up inference to massive data sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Recent developments in stochastic variational inference methods have shown promising results for LDA and the HDP topic model <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>[9] <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. We continue this development for hierarchical topic modeling with the nested HDP. Using stochastic variational inference, we demonstrate an ability to efficiently handle very large corpora. This is a major benefit to complex models such as tree-structured topic models, which require significant amounts of data to support their large size.</p><p>We organize the paper as follows: In Section 2 we review the Bayesian nonparametric priors that we incorporate in our model-the Dirichlet process, nested Chinese restaurant process and hierarchical Dirichlet process. In Section 3 we present our proposed nested HDP model for hierarchical topic modeling. In Section 4 we review stochastic variational inference and present an inference algorithm for nHDPs that scales well to massive data sets. We present empirical results in Section 5. We first compare the nHDP with the nCRP on three relatively small data sets. We then evaluate our stochastic algorithm on 1.8 million documents from The New York Times and 2.7 million documents from Wikipedia, comparing performance with stochastic LDA and HDP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">BACKGROUND: BAYESIAN NONPARAMET-</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RIC PRIORS FOR TOPIC MODELS</head><p>The nested hierarchical Dirichlet process (nHDP) builds on a collection of existing Bayesian nonparametric priors. In this section, we review these priors: the Dirichlet process, nested Chinese restaurant process and hierarchical Dirichlet process. We also review constructive representations for these processes that we will use for posterior inference of the nHDP topic model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Dirichlet processes</head><p>The Dirichlet process (DP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> is the foundation for a large collection of Bayesian nonparametric models that rely on mixtures to represent distributions on data. Mixture models work by partitioning a data set according to statistical traits shared by members of the same cell. Dirichlet process priors are effective in learning a suitable number of traits for representing the data, in addition to the parameters of the mixture. The basic form of a Dirichlet process mixture model is</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">W n |ϕ n ∼ F W (ϕ n ), ϕ n |G iid ∼ G, G = ∞ i=1 p i δ θi . (1)</formula><p>With this representation, data W 1 , . . . , W N are distributed according to a family of distributions F W with respective parameters ϕ 1 , . . . , ϕ N . These parameters are drawn from the distribution G, which is discrete and potentially infinite, as the DP allows it to be. This discreteness induces a partition of the data W according to the sharing of the atoms {θ i } among the parameters {ϕ n } that are selected.</p><p>The Dirichlet process is a stochastic process for generating G. To briefly review, let (Θ, B) be a measurable space, G 0 a probability measure on it and α &gt; 0.</p><p>Ferguson <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> proved the existence of a stochastic process G where, for all measurable partitions {B 1 , . . . , B k } of Θ, with B i ∈ B, (G(B 1 ), . . . , G(B k )) ∼ Dirichlet(αG 0 (B 1 ), . . . , αG 0 (B k )), abbreviated as G ∼ DP(αG 0 ). It has been shown that G is discrete (with probability one) even when G 0 is nonatomic <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Thus the DP prior is a good candidate for G in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) since it generates discrete distributions on continuous parameter spaces. For most applications G 0 is diffuse, and so representations of G at the granularity of the atoms are necessary for inference; we next review two of these approaches to working with this infinitedimensional distribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Chinese restaurant processes</head><p>The Chinese restaurant process (CRP) avoids directly working with G by integrating it out <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In doing so, the values of ϕ 1 , . . . , ϕ N become dependent, with the value of ϕ n+1 given ϕ 1 , . . . , ϕ n distributed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ϕ n+1 |ϕ 1 , . . . , ϕ n ∼ α α + n G 0 + n i=1 1 α + n δ ϕi .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>That is, ϕ n+1 takes the value of one of the previously observed ϕ i with probability n α+n , and a value drawn from G 0 with probability α α+n , which will be unique when G 0 is continuous. This displays the clustering property of the CRP and also gives insight into the impact of α, since it is evident that the number of unique ϕ i grows like α ln n. In the limit n → ∞, the distribution in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) converges to a random measure distributed according to a Dirichlet process <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The CRP is socalled because of an analogy to a Chinese restaurant, where a new customer (datum) sits at a table (selects a parameter) with probability proportional to the number of previous customers at that table, or selects a new table with probability proportional to α.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">A stick-breaking construction</head><p>Where the Chinese restaurant process works with G ∼ DP(αG 0 ) implicitly through ϕ, a stick-breaking construction allows one to directly construct G before drawing any ϕ n . Sethuraman <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> showed that if G is constructed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">G = ∞ i=1 V i i-1 j=1 (1 -V j )δ θi , V i iid ∼ Beta(1, α), θ i iid ∼ G 0 ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>then G ∼ DP(αG 0 ). The variable V i can be interpreted as the proportion broken from the remainder of a unit length stick, j&lt;i (1 -V j ). As the index i increases, more random variables in [0, 1] are multiplied, and thus the weights decrease to zero exponentially. The expectation</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">E[V i j&lt;i (1 -V j )] = α i-1</formula><p>(1+α) i gives a sense of the impact of α on these weights. This explicit construction of G maintains the independence among ϕ 1 , . . . , ϕ N as written in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>), which is a significant advantage of this representation for mean-field variational inference that is not present in the CRP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Nested Chinese restaurant processes</head><p>Nested Chinese restaurant processes (nCRP) are a treestructured extension of the CRP that are useful for hierarchical topic modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. They extend the CRP analogy to a nesting of restaurants in the following way: After selecting a table (parameter) according to a CRP, the customer departs for another restaurant uniquely indicated by that table. Upon arrival, the customer acts according to the CRP for the new restaurant, and again departs for a restaurant only accessible through the table selected. This occurs for a potentially infinite sequence of restaurants, which generates a sequence of parameters for the customer according to the selected tables.</p><p>A natural interpretation of the nCRP is as a tree where each parent has an infinite number of children. Starting from the root node, a path is traversed down the tree. Given the current node, a child node is selected with probability proportional to the previous number of times it was selected among its siblings, or a new child is selected with probability proportional to α. As with the CRP, the underlying mixing measure of the nCRP also has a constructive representation useful for variational inference, which we will use in our nHDP construction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Constructing the nCRP</head><p>The nesting of Dirichlet processes that leads to the nCRP gives rise to a stick-breaking construction <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. We develop the notation for this construction here and use it later in our construction of the nested HDP. Let i l = (i 1 , . . . , i l ) be a path to a node at level l of the tree. 1 According to the stick-breaking version of the nCRP, the children of node i l are countably infinite, with the probability of transitioning to child j equal to the jth break of a stick-breaking construction. Each child corresponds to a parameter drawn independently from G 0 . Letting the index of the parameter identify the index of the child, this results in the following DP for the children of node i l ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">G i l = ∞ j=1 V i l ,j j-1 m=1 (1 -V i l ,m )δ θ (i l ,j) , V i l ,j iid ∼ Beta(1, α), θ (i l ,j) iid ∼ G 0 .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>1. That is, from the root node first select the child with index i 1 ; from node i 1 = (i 1 ), select the child with index i 2 ; from node i 2 = (i 1 , i 2 ) select the child with index i 3 , and so on to level l with each i k ∈ N. We ignore the root i 0 , which is shared by all paths.</p><p>If the next node is child j, then the nCRP transitions to DP G i l+1 , where i l+1 has index j appended to i l , that is i l+1 = (i l , j). A path down the tree givens a sequence of parameters ϕ = (ϕ 1 , ϕ 2 , . . . ), where the parameter ϕ l correspond to an atom θ i l at level l. Hierarchical topic models use these sequences of parameters to give the topics for generating documents. Other nested DPs have been considered as well, such as a two-leveled nDP where all parameters are selected from the leaves <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Nested CRP topic models</head><p>Hierarchical topic models based on the nested CRP use a globally shared tree to generate a corpus of documents. Starting with the construction of nested Dirichlet processes as described above, each document selects a path down the tree according to a Markov process, which produces a sequence of topics ϕ d = (ϕ d,1 , ϕ d,2 , . . . ) used to generate the dth document. As with other topic models, each word in a document, W d,n , is represented by an index in the set {1, . . . , V} and the topics θ i l appearing in ϕ d are V-dimensional probability vectors with Dirichlet prior G 0 = Dirichlet(λ 0 1 V ).</p><p>For each document d, an additional stick-breaking process provides a distribution on the topics in ϕ d ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">G (d) = ∞ j=1 U d,j j-1 m=1 (1 -U d,m )δ ϕ d,j , U d,j iid ∼ Beta(γ 1 , γ 2 ).<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Since this is not a DP, U d,j has two free parameters, γ 1 and γ 2 . Following the standard method, words for document d are generated by first drawing a topic i.i.d. from G (d) , and then drawing the word index from the discrete distribution with the selected topic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3">Issues with the nCRP</head><p>As discussed in the introduction, a significant drawback of the nCRP for topic modeling is that each document follows one path down the tree. Therefore, all thematic content of a document must be contained within that single sequence of topics. Since the nCRP is meant to characterize the thematic content of a corpus in increasing levels of specificity, this creates a combinatorial problem, where similar topics will appear in many parts of the tree to account for the possibility that they appear as a topic of the document (e.g., the sport/medicine example given in the introduction). In practice, nCRP trees are typically truncated at three levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>[4], since learning deeper levels becomes difficult due to the exponential increase in nodes. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref> In this situation each document has three topics for modeling its entire thematic content, which is likely insufficient, and so a blending of multiple topics is bound to occur during inference. The nCRP is a Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) prior, but it performs nonparametric clustering of the paths selected at the document level, rather than at the word level. Though the same distribution on a tree is shared by a corpus, each document can differentiate itself only by the path it choses, as well as the distribution on topics in that path. The key issue with the nCRP is the restrictiveness of this single path allowed to a document. However, if instead each word were allowed to follow its own path according to an nCRP, the distribution on paths would be the same for all documents, which is clearly not desired. Our goal is to develop a hierarchical topic model that does not prohibit a document from using topics in different parts of the tree. Our solution to this problem is to employ the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Hierarchical Dirichlet processes</head><p>The HDP is a multi-level version of the Dirichlet process <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. It makes use of the idea that the base distribution on the continuous space Θ can be discrete, which is useful because a discrete distribution allows for multiple draws from the DP prior to place probability mass on the same subset of atoms. Hence different groups of data can share the same atoms, but have different probability distributions on them. A discrete base is needed, but the atoms are unknown in advance. The HDP models these atoms by drawing the base from a DP prior. This leads to the hierarchical process</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">G d |G iid ∼ DP(βG), G ∼ DP(αG 0 ),<label>(6)</label></formula><p>for groups d = 1, . . . , D. This prior has been used to great effect in topic modeling as a nonparametric extension of LDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and related LDA-based models <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>[17] <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>As with the DP, explicit representations of the HDP are necessary for inference. The representation we use relies on two levels of Sethuraman's stick breaking construction. For this construction, first sample G as in Eq.</p><p>(3), and then sample G d in the same way,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">G d = ∞ i=1 V d i i-1 j=1 (1 -V d j )δ φi , V d i iid ∼ Beta(1, β), φ i iid ∼ G. (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">)</formula><p>This form is identical to Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>), with the key difference that G is discrete, and so atoms φ i will repeat. An advantage of this representation is that all random variables are i.i.d., which aids variational inference strategies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">NESTED HIERARCHICAL DIRICHLET PRO-CESSES FOR TOPIC MODELING</head><p>In building on the nCRP framework, our goal is to allow for each document to have access to the entire tree, while still learning document-specific distributions on topics that are thematically coherent. Ideally, each document will still exhibit a dominant path corresponding to its main themes, but with off-shoots allowing for other topics. Our two major changes to the nCRP formulation toward this end are that (i) each word follows its own path to a topic, and (ii) each document has its own distribution on paths in a shared tree. The BNP tools discussed above make this a straightforward task.</p><p>In the proposed nested hierarchical Dirichlet process (nHDP), we split the process of generating a document's distribution on topics into two parts: first, generating a document's distribution on paths down the tree, and second, generating a word's distribution on terminating at a particular node within those paths.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Constructing a distribution on paths</head><p>With the nHDP, all documents share a global nCRP drawn according to the stick-breaking construction in Section 2.2.1. Denote this tree by T . As discussed, T is simply an infinite collection of Dirichlet processes with a continuous base distribution G 0 and a transition rule between DPs. According to this rule, from a root Dirichlet process G i0 , a path is followed by drawing ϕ l+1 ∼ G i l for l = 0, 1, 2, . . . , where i 0 is a constant root index, and i l = (i 1 , . . . , i l ) indexes the DP associated with the topic ϕ l = θ i l . With the nested HDP, instead of following paths according to the global T , we use each Dirichlet process in T as a base distribution for a local DP drawn independently for each document.</p><p>That is, for document d we construct a tree T d where, for each</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">G i l ∈ T , we draw a corresponding G (d) i l ∈ T d according to the Dirichlet process G (d) i l ∼ DP(βG i l ).<label>(8)</label></formula><p>As discussed in Section 2.3,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">G (d) i l</formula><p>will have the same atoms as G i l , but with different probability weights on them.

Starting from the root node of T d , each word in the document will have high probability of transitioning to the same node when moving down the tree, with some small probability of diverging into a different topic.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Generating a document</head><p>With the tree T d for document d we have a method for selecting word-specific paths that are thematically coherent, meaning they tend to reuse the same path while allowing for off-shoots. We next discuss how to generate a document with this tree. As discussed in Section 2.2.2, with the nCRP the atoms selected for a document by its path through T have a unique stickbreaking distribution that determines which level any particular word comes from. We generalize this idea to the tree T d with an overlapping stick-breaking construction as follows.</p><p>For each node i l , we draw a document-specific beta random variable that acts as a stochastic switch. Given a pointer that is currently at node i l , the beta random variable determines the probability that we draw from the topic at that node or continue further down the tree.

The leftmost term in this expression is the probability of path i l , the right term is the probability that the word does not select the first l -1 topics, but does select the lth. Since all random variables are independent, a simple product form results that will significantly aid the development of a posterior inference algorithm. The overlapping nature of this stick-breaking construction on the levels of a sequence is evident from the fact that the random variables U are shared for the first l values by all paths along the subtree starting at node i l . A similar tree-structured prior distribution was presented by Adams, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> in which all groups shared the same distribution on a tree and entire objects (e.g., images or documents) were clustered within a single node.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">The inference algorithm</head><p>We develop a stochastic variational inference algorithm for approximate posterior inference of the nHDP topic model. As discussed in our general review of stochastic inference, this entails optimizing the local variational parameters for a subset of documents, followed by a step along the natural gradient of the global variational parameters. We distinguish between local and global variables for the nHDP in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> we also give the variational q distributions selected for each variable. In almost all cases we select this distribution to be in the same family as the prior. We point out two additional latent indicator variables for inference: c d,n , which indicates the topic of word W d,n , and z (d) i,j , which points to the atom in G i associated with the jth break in G (d) i using the construction given in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">9</ref>). Since we wish to consider large trees, and because there is slightly more overhead in calculating the distribution for each document than in models such as LDA and the HDP, the word allocation step is more time consuming for the nHDP. Additionally, we seek an efficient means for learning the indicators z (d) i,j . Since each document will use a small subset of topics, which translates to a small subtree of the entire tree, our goal is to pick out a subtree in advance for the document to work with. This will reduce the number of topics to do inference over for each document, speeding up the algorithm, and determine the delta-function indicators for z (d) i,j , which point to the "activated" nodes. To this end, we introduce a third aspect to our inference algorithm in which we pick a small subtree for each document in advance. By this we mean that we only allow words in a document to be allocated to the subtree selected for that document and fix the probability that the indicator c d,n corresponds to topics outside this subtree to zero. As we will show, by selecting a subtree we are in effect learning a truncated stick-breaking construction of the tree for each document. If a node has two children in the subtree, then algorithmically we will have a two-node truncated construction for that DP of the specific document we are considering.</p><p>We select the subtree from T for each document using a greedy algorithm. This greedy algorithm is performed with respect to maximizing the variational objective function. Being an optimization method with one requirement (that we maximize a fixed objective), variational inference has considerable freedom in this regard. We discuss this greedy algorithm below, followed by the variational parameter updates for the local and global q distributions. Algorithm 2 gives an outline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Greedy subtree selection</head><p>As mentioned, we perform a greedy algorithm with respect to the variational objective function to determine a subtree from T for each document. We first describe the algorithm followed by a mathematical representation.</p><p>Starting from the root node, we sequentially add nodes from T , selecting from those currently "activated." An activated node is one whose parent is contained within the subtree but which is not itself in the subtree.</p><p>To determine which node to add, we look at which node will give the greatest increase in the variational objective when the q distributions for the documentspecific beta distributions are fixed to their priors and the variational distribution for each word's topic indicator q distribution (ν d,n in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>) is zero on the remaining unactivated nodes. That is, we then ask the question: Which of the activated nodes not currently in the subtree will lead to the greatest increase in the variational objective under this restricted q distribution?</p><p>The reason we consider this restricted distribution is that there is a closed form calculation for each node, and so no iterations are required in this step and the algorithm is much faster. Calculating this score only involves optimizing the variational parameter ν d,n for each word over the current subtree plus the candidate node. We continue adding the maximizing node until the marginal increase in the objective falls below a threshold. We give a more formal description of this below. 4.2.1.1 Coordinate update for q(z</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">(d) i,j ): As defined in Table 2, z (d)</formula><p>i,j is the variable that indicates the index of the atom from the global DP G i pointed to by the jth stickbreaking weight in G (d) i . We select a delta q distribution for this variable, meaning we make a hard assignment for this value. These values also define the subtree for document d. Starting with an empty tree, all atoms in G i0 constitute the activated set. Adding the first node is equivalent to determining the value for z For a subtree of size t corresponding to document d, let the set I d,t contain the index values of the included nodes, let S d,t = {i : pa(i) ∈ I d,t , i ∈ I d,t } be the set of candidate nodes to add to T . Then provided the marginal increase in the variational objective is above a preset threshold, we increment the subtree by letting</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">I d,t+1 ← I d,t ∪ i * , where i * = arg max i ∈S d,t N d n=1 max ν d,n : C d,t,i E q [ln p(W d,n |c d,n , θ)] + E q [ln p(c d,n , z (d) |V, V d , U d )]-E q [ln q(c d,n )]. (16)</formula><p>We let C d,t,i denote the discussed conditions, that ν d,n (i) = 0 for all i ∈ I d,t ∪ i and that q(•) is fixed to the prior for all other distributions. The optimal values for ν d,n are given below in Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</p><p>We note two aspects of this greedy algorithm. First, though the stick-breaking construction of the documentlevel DP given in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">9</ref>) allows for atoms to repeat, in this algorithm each additional atom is new, since there is no advantage in duplicating atoms. Therefore, the algorithm approximates each G (d) i by selecting and reordering a subset of atoms from G i for its stickbreaking construction. (The subtree T d may also contain zero atoms or one atom from a G i .) The second aspect we point out is the changing prior on the same node in T . If the atom θ (i,m) is a candidate for addition, then it remains a candidate until it is either selected by a z (d) i,j , or the algorithm terminates. The prior on selecting this atom changes, however, depending on whether it is a candidate for z (d) i,j or z (d) i,j . Therefore, incorporating a sibling of θ (i,m) impacts the prior on incorporating θ (i,m) .</p></div>

We first present batch results on three smaller data sets to verify that our multi-path approach gives an improvement over the single-path nested CRP. We then move to the stochastic inference setting, where we perform experiments on 1.8 million documents from The New York Times and 2.7 million documents from Wikipedia. We compare with other recent stochastic inference algorithms for topic models: stochastic LDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and the stochastic HDP <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. As is fairly standard with the optimization-based variational inference, we use truncated stick-breaking processes for all DPs <ref type="bibr">[25][26]</ref>. With this method, we truncate the posterior approximation by not allowing words to come from topics beyond the truncation index (i.e., fixing c d,n ((i, j)) = 0 for all j &gt; n). The truncation is set to something reasonably large, and the posterior inference procedure then shrinks the number of used topics to something smaller than the number provided. In our large-scale experiments, we truncate to n 1 = 20 first level nodes, n 2 = 10 children for each of these nodes and n 3 = 5 children of each of these second level nodes. We consider three level trees, corresponding intuitively to "general", "specific" and "specialized" levels of words.

As with most Bayesian models, inference for hierarchical topic models can benefit greatly from a good initialization. Our goal is to find a method for quickly centering the posterior mean of each topic so that they contain some information about their hierarchical relationships. We briefly discuss our approach for initializing the global variational topic parameters λ i of the nHDP. Using a small set of documents (e.g, 10,000) from the training set, we form the empirical distribution for each document on the vocabulary. We then perform k-means clustering of these probability vectors using the L 1 distance measure (i.e., total variation). At the top level, we partition the data into n 1 groups, corresponding to n 1 children of the root node from the truncated stickbreaking process. We then subtract the mean of a group (a probability vector) from all data within that group, set any negative values to zero and renormalize. We loosely think of this as the "probability of what remains"a distribution on words not captured by the parent distributions. Within each group we again perform kmeans clustering, obtaining n 2 probability vectors for each of the n 1 groups, and again subtracting, setting negative values to zero and renormalizing the remainder of each probability vector for a document.</p><p>Through this hierarchical k-means clustering, we obtain n 1 probability vectors at the top level, n 2 probability vectors beneath each top-level vector for the second level, n 3 probability vectors beneath each of these second-level vectors, etc. The n i vectors obtained from any sub-group of data are refinements of an already coherent sub-group of data, since that sub-group is itself a cluster from a larger group. Therefore, the resulting tree will have some thematic coherence. The clusters from this algorithm are used to initialize the nodes within the nHDP tree. For a mean probability vector λi obtained from this algorithm, we set the corresponding variational parameter for the topic Dirichlet distribution q to</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">λ i = N (κ λi + (1 -κ)(1/V + v i )) for κ ∈ [0, 1], N a scaling factor and v i iid ∼ Dirichlet(1001 V /V).</formula><p>This initializes the mean of θ i to be slightly peaked around λi , while the uniform vector and κ help determine the variance and v i provides some randomness. In our algorithms we set κ = 0.5 and N equal to the number of documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">A batch comparison</head><p>Before comparing our stochastic inference algorithm for the nHDP with similar algorithms for LDA and the HDP, we compare a batch version with the nCRP on three smaller data sets. This will verify the advantage of giving each document access to the entire tree versus forcing each document to follow one path. We compare the variational nHDP topic model with both the variational nCRP <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and the Gibbs sampling nCRP <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, using the parameter settings in those papers to facilitate comparison. We consider three corpora for our experiments: (i) The Journal of the ACM, a collection of 536 abstracts from the years 1987-2004 with vocabulary size 1,539; (ii) The Psychological Review, a collection of 1,272 abstracts from the years 1967-2003 with vocabulary size 1,971; and (iii) The Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, a collection of 5,000 abstracts from the years 1991-2001 with a vocabulary size of 7,762. The average number of words per document for the three corpora are 45, 108 and 179, respectively.</p><p>As mentioned, variational inference for Dirichlet process priors uses a truncation of the variational distribution, which limits the number of topics that are learned <ref type="bibr">[25][26]</ref>. This truncation is set to a number larger than the anticipated number of topics necessary for modeling the data set, but can be increased if more are needed <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.

Because these three data sets contain stop words, we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> by including a root node shared by all documents for this batch problem only. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, we perform five-fold cross validation to evaluate performance on each corpus. We present our results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, where we show the predictive log likelihood on a held-out test set. We see that for all data sets, the variational nHDP outperforms the variational nCRP. For the two larger data sets, the variational nHDP also outperforms Gibbs sampling for the nCRP. Given the relative sizes of these corpora, we see that the benefit of learning a per-document distribution on the full tree rather than a shared distribution on paths appears to increase as the corpus size and document size increase. Since we are interested in the "Big Data" regime, this strongly hints at an advantage of our nHDP approach over the nCRP. We omit a comparison with Gibbs nHDP since MCMC methods are not amenable to large data sets for this problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Stochastic inference for large corpora</head><p>We next present an evaluation of our stochastic variational inference algorithm on The New York Times and Wikipedia.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.2">The New York Times</head><p>We first present our results for The New York Times.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> we show the average predictive log likelihood on unseen words as a function of the number of documents processed during model learning. We see an improvement in performance as the amount of data processed increases. We also note an improvement in the performance of the nHDP compared with LDA and the HDP. In Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> we give a sense of the size of the tree as a function of documents seen. Since all topics aren't used equally, we show the minimum number of nodes containing 95%, 99% and 99.9% of all data in the posterior. In Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> we show document-level statistics from the test set at the final step of the algorithm. These include the word allocations by level and the number of topics used per level. We note that while the tree has three levels, roughly 12 topics are being used (in varying degrees) per document. This is in contrast to the three topics that would be available to any document with the nCRP. Thus there is a clear advantage in allowing each document to have access to the entire tree. We show the adaptively learned step size in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> we show example topics from the model and their relative structure.

The model learns a meaningful hierarchical structure; for example, the sports subtree branches into the various sports, which themselves appear to branch by teams. In the foreign affairs subtree, children tend to group by major subregion and then branch out into subregion or issue. If a sports document incorporated topics on foreign affairs, the nHDP would allow words to split into both parts of the tree, but with the nCRP a document would have to pick one or the other, and so a tree could not be learned that distinguished topics with this level of precision.</p><p>The algorithm took roughly 20 hours to make one pass through the data set using a single desktop computer, which was sufficient for the model to converge to a set of topics.

As with The New York Times, we see the nonparametric nature of the model in Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>. Though the model has an 1,220 initial nodes, a small subset are ultimately used by the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.4">Sensitivity analysis</head><p>We present a brief sensitivity analysis of some parameters of the nHDP topic model using the Wikipedia corpus. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12</ref>. Wikipedia: Sensitivity to parameter vector (γ 1 , γ 2 ) for the stochastic switches. We show the results from Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref> for different settings with β = 1. In general, we find that the results were not sensitive to the parameter λ 0 of the base Dirichlet distribution, which is consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. We note that this is typically not the case for topic models, but because of the massive quantity of data we are working with, the data overwhelms the prior in this case. This was similarly found with the global DP parameter α. The document-specific variables have a more significant impact since they only use the data from a single document in their posteriors. In Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">13</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">14</ref>we show the sensitivity of the model to the parameters β and (γ 1 , γ 2 ). We consider several values for these parameters, holding γ 1 + γ 2 = 1. As can be seen, the model structure is fairly robust to these values. The tree structure does respond as would be expected from the prior, but there is no major change. The quantitative results in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">14</ref> indicate that the quality of the model is robust as well. We note that this relative insensitivity is within a parameter range that we believe a priori to be reasonable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION</head><p>We have presented the nested hierarchical Dirichlet process (nHDP), an extension of the nested Chinese restaurant process (nCRP) that allows each observation to follow its own path to a topic in the tree. Starting with a stick-breaking construction for the nCRP, the new model samples document-specific path distributions for a shared tree using a nested hierarchy of Dirichlet processes. By giving a document access to the entire tree, we are able to borrow thematic content from various parts of the tree in constructing a document. We developed a stochastic variational inference algorithm that is scalable to very large data sets. We compared the stochastic nHDP topic model with stochastic LDA and HDP and showed how the nHDP can learn meaningful topic hierarchies.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>1 ;</head><label>1</label><figDesc>in general, creating a subtree for T d , which we denote as T d , is equivalent to determining which z (d) i,j to include in T d and the atoms to which they point.</figDesc></figure>
