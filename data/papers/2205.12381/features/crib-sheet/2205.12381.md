- **Objective**: Develop an assistive human-machine interface that translates user command signals into actions without prior mapping or supervision.
  
- **Key Concept**: Intuitive interfaces reduce noise in user commands, formalized as maximizing mutual information \( I(x_t, (s_t, s_{t+1})) \).

- **Methodology**: 
  - **Co-adaptation Process**: Start with a random interface, measure mutual information, and update the interface to maximize it through reinforcement learning.
  - **MIMI Algorithm**: Mutual Information Maximizing Interface (MIMI) learns an interface from scratch without prior knowledge of tasks or user feedback.

- **Evaluation Metrics**: 
  - Spearman's rank correlation \( \rho = 0.43 \) between mutual information scores and ground-truth task completion metrics across various domains.
  
- **Experimental Setup**: 
  - Large-scale observational study with 540K examples across keyboard, eye gaze interfaces, and video games.
  - Small-scale user study with 12 participants for 2D cursor control and one expert user for Lunar Lander game.

- **Information Theory Framework**: 
  - User interacts through a noisy channel; the interface observes command signals and takes actions based on state transitions.
  - Conditional mutual information \( I(x_t, s_{t+1} | s_t) \) and mutual information \( I(s_t, x_t) \) are critical for evaluating interface effectiveness.

- **Surrogate Reward Function**: Defined as the information rate of the interface, correlating positively with the ground-truth reward.

- **Algorithm 1: MIMI-EVALUATE(π)**:
  - Collect data \( D \) from user commands and state transitions.
  - Optimize mutual information lower bound using training and validation sets.

- **Key Findings**: 
  - Interfaces with higher mutual information scores lead to better task performance.
  - MIMI can learn effective interfaces in under 30 minutes of human-in-the-loop training.

```

- **Conclusion**: The proposed method allows for the development of intuitive interfaces that adapt to user commands, enhancing the effectiveness of human-machine interaction without requiring explicit supervision.
