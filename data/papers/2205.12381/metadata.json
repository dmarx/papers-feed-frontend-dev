  "title": "First Contact: Unsupervised Human-Machine Co-Adaptation via Mutual\n  Information Maximization",
  "authors": "Siddharth Reddy, Sergey Levine, Anca D. Dragan",
  "abstract": "How can we train an assistive human-machine interface (e.g., an\nelectromyography-based limb prosthesis) to translate a user's raw command\nsignals into the actions of a robot or computer when there is no prior mapping,\nwe cannot ask the user for supervision in the form of action labels or reward\nfeedback, and we do not have prior knowledge of the tasks the user is trying to\naccomplish? The key idea in this paper is that, regardless of the task, when an\ninterface is more intuitive, the user's commands are less noisy. We formalize\nthis idea as a completely unsupervised objective for optimizing interfaces: the\nmutual information between the user's command signals and the induced state\ntransitions in the environment. To evaluate whether this mutual information\nscore can distinguish between effective and ineffective interfaces, we conduct\nan observational study on 540K examples of users operating various keyboard and\neye gaze interfaces for typing, controlling simulated robots, and playing video\ngames. The results show that our mutual information scores are predictive of\nthe ground-truth task completion metrics in a variety of domains, with an\naverage Spearman's rank correlation of 0.43. In addition to offline evaluation\nof existing interfaces, we use our unsupervised objective to learn an interface\nfrom scratch: we randomly initialize the interface, have the user attempt to\nperform their desired tasks using the interface, measure the mutual information\nscore, and update the interface to maximize mutual information through\nreinforcement learning. We evaluate our method through a user study with 12\nparticipants who perform a 2D cursor control task using a perturbed mouse, and\nan experiment with one user playing the Lunar Lander game using hand gestures.\nThe results show that we can learn an interface from scratch, without any user\nsupervision or prior knowledge of tasks, in under 30 minutes.",
