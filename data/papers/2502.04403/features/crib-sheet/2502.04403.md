- **Definition of Agency**: Agency is defined as a system's capacity to steer outcomes toward a goal, characterized by four essential properties: individuality, source of action, normativity, and adaptivity.

- **Frame-Dependence of Agency**: The attribution of agency to a system is fundamentally dependent on a choice of reference frame, which includes arbitrary commitments that influence the assessment of agency.

- **Four Properties of Agency**:
  1. **Individuality**: The system must have a boundary that separates it from its environment. This boundary is frame-dependent, as different boundaries can yield different assessments of agency.
  2. **Source of Action**: The system must be the source of its own actions. This property is also frame-dependent, as it relies on the choice of causal variables in a causal model.
  3. **Normativity**: The system must have goals that regulate its interactions. The determination of meaningful goal-directedness is frame-dependent, requiring additional principles to assess the relevance of goals.
  4. **Adaptivity**: The system's outputs must be influenced by its inputs. Adaptivity is frame-dependent, as it depends on the reference class chosen for evaluation.

- **Claims Supporting Frame-Dependence**:
  - **Claim 1**: Individuality is frame-dependent; boundaries can vary, affecting the identification of agency.
  - **Claim 2**: The source of action is frame-dependent; different causal variable choices can lead to different conclusions about agency.
  - **Claim 3**: Normativity is frame-dependent; the meaningfulness of goals depends on arbitrary reference points.
  - **Claim 4**: Adaptivity is frame-dependent; relevance of inputs is determined by the chosen reference class.

- **Philosophical Implications**: The need for frame-dependence in understanding agency suggests that any basic science of agency must account for the context in which agency is evaluated.

- **Future Directions**: A rigorous mathematical construction of reference frames in the context of agency and reinforcement learning is proposed as a fruitful area for further research.
