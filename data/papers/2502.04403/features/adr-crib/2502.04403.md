is a clear illustration of how adaptivity, like the other properties of agency, is fundamentally frame-dependent.

### Detailed Technical Explanations/Justifications/Rationale for Researchers' Decisions

1. **Definition of Agency**:
   The researchers define agency as a system's capacity to steer outcomes toward a goal, which is a synthesis of various perspectives from biology, philosophy, and cognitive science. This definition is chosen to encapsulate the essential characteristics of agency, including individuality, source of action, normativity, and adaptivity. By grounding the definition in a multi-disciplinary context, the researchers aim to create a comprehensive framework that can be applied across different systems, from biological organisms to artificial agents.

2. **Frame-Dependence of Agency**:
   The researchers argue that agency is frame-dependent, meaning that the attribution of agency to a system relies on the chosen reference frame. This decision is justified by the observation that different reference frames can yield different conclusions about whether a system possesses agency. By emphasizing frame-dependence, the researchers highlight the subjective nature of agency attribution, which can vary based on the observer's commitments and perspectives.

3. **Selection of Reference Frames**:
   The selection of reference frames is critical because it determines how the properties of agency are evaluated. The researchers propose that a reference frame should include a boundary definition, causal variables, principles for goal identification, and criteria for adaptivity. This structured approach allows for a systematic analysis of agency across different systems and contexts, ensuring that the evaluation is comprehensive and consistent.

4. **Boundary Definition for Agency**:
   Establishing a boundary is essential for identifying which system is being evaluated for agency. The researchers note that boundaries can be drawn in various ways, leading to different interpretations of agency. This decision is justified by examples from the literature, such as the varying boundaries around a person and a stick, which illustrate the complexity of defining individuality in agency. The researchers argue that the choice of boundary is inherently arbitrary, reinforcing the frame-dependence of agency.

5. **Causal Variables in Agency Attribution**:
   The researchers emphasize that the identification of a system as the source of its own action depends on the choice of causal variables. This decision is justified by referencing recent work that shows how different causal models can lead to different conclusions about agency. By highlighting the role of causal variables, the researchers underscore the complexity of agency attribution and the need for careful consideration of the underlying assumptions.

6. **Meaningful Goal-Pursuit Criteria**:
   The researchers argue that determining whether a system is meaningfully pursuing a goal requires additional commitments that are arbitrary. This is justified by discussing the challenges of distinguishing between meaningful and trivial goals in various systems. By framing goal-pursuit as a frame-dependent property, the researchers highlight the subjective nature of goal attribution and the need for a reference frame to evaluate it.

7. **Normativity in Agency**:
   The researchers assert that normativity, or goal-directedness, is frame-dependent because the criteria for what constitutes meaningful goal-directed behavior can vary. This decision is supported by referencing classical results in inverse reinforcement learning, which demonstrate that reward functions can be under-determined by behavior. By emphasizing the role of external principles in defining normativity, the researchers illustrate the complexity of agency attribution.

8. **Adaptivity Measurement in Systems**:
   The researchers argue that adaptivity is also frame-dependent, as it relies on the choice of reference class for evaluating changes in behavior. This is justified by citing previous work that shows how different interpretations of adaptivity can lead to different conclusions about a system's agency. By framing adaptivity in this way, the researchers highlight the importance of context in agency evaluation.

9. **Implications of Frame-Dependence for RL**:
   The researchers discuss the implications of frame-dependence for reinforcement learning (RL), suggesting that understanding agency is crucial for developing effective RL systems. This decision is justified by the argument that agency is foundational to learning and decision-making processes. By emphasizing the need for a nuanced understanding of agency, the researchers advocate for a more sophisticated approach to RL that considers the frame-dependent nature of agency.

10. **Philosophical Foundations of Agency**:
    The researchers draw on philosophical arguments to support their claims about agency, referencing key thinkers like Dennett and Barandiaran. This decision is justified by the need to ground their framework in established philosophical discourse, which lends credibility to their claims and provides a rich context for understanding agency.

11. **Comparison of Agency Across Systems**:
    The researchers emphasize the importance of comparing agency across different systems, arguing that a frame-dependent approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of agency in diverse contexts. This decision is justified by the observation that agency is not a binary property but exists on a spectrum, depending on the chosen reference frame.

12. **Role of Observer in Agency Attribution**:
    The researchers highlight the observer's role in agency attribution, arguing that different observers may arrive at different conclusions about a system's agency based on their reference frames. This decision is justified by the subjective nature of agency evaluation, which
