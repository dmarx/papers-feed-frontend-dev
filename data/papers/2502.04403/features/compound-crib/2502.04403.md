### Detailed Technical Explanations/Justifications/Rationale for Researchers' Decisions

#### Definition of Agency
The researchers define agency as a system's capacity to steer outcomes toward a goal, characterized by four essential properties: individuality, source of action, normativity, and adaptivity. This definition is grounded in the understanding that agency is not merely about the ability to act but involves a structured interaction with the environment that is goal-oriented. Each property serves to delineate the conditions under which a system can be considered an agent, emphasizing that agency is a complex interplay of various factors rather than a singular trait.

1. **Individuality**: This property emphasizes the necessity of a boundary that distinguishes the agent from its environment. The researchers argue that without a clear demarcation, it becomes challenging to attribute agency, as the system's interactions could be misconstrued as mere environmental responses rather than intentional actions.

2. **Source of Action**: This property asserts that an agent must originate its actions. The researchers highlight that the attribution of agency is contingent upon identifying the causal variables that define the system's actions. This necessitates a careful consideration of the system's internal mechanisms versus external influences.

3. **Normativity**: The researchers argue that agency involves having goals that guide behavior. This property underscores the importance of understanding what constitutes meaningful goals, as arbitrary or trivial goals do not confer agency. The researchers suggest that the assessment of goal-directedness requires additional principles to determine the relevance of the goals.

4. **Adaptivity**: This property indicates that an agent's outputs must be responsive to its inputs. The researchers emphasize that adaptivity is not a static trait but rather a dynamic interaction that can vary based on the chosen reference frame for evaluation.

#### Frame-Dependence of Agency
The researchers assert that the attribution of agency is fundamentally dependent on a choice of reference frame, which includes arbitrary commitments that influence the assessment of agency. This claim is pivotal because it challenges the notion of agency as an absolute characteristic of a system. Instead, it posits that agency is contextually determined, shaped by the observer's perspective and the criteria they employ to evaluate the system.

- **Reference Frame**: The concept of a reference frame is introduced as a collection of commitments that guide the evaluation of agency. This includes defining boundaries, selecting causal variables, establishing meaningful goals, and determining what constitutes adaptive behavior. The researchers argue that different reference frames can yield divergent conclusions about a system's agency, highlighting the subjective nature of agency assessment.

#### Four Properties of Agency
The researchers provide a detailed examination of each property of agency, illustrating how each is frame-dependent:

1. **Individuality**: The researchers argue that the identification of an agent's boundary is not straightforward and can vary significantly based on the context. For instance, the boundary could encompass different components of a system, leading to different interpretations of agency. This variability underscores the frame-dependent nature of individuality.

2. **Source of Action**: The researchers emphasize that determining the source of action relies on the choice of causal variables in a model. Different selections can lead to contrasting conclusions about whether a system is the source of its actions, reinforcing the idea that agency is not an inherent quality but rather contingent on the analytical framework employed.

3. **Normativity**: The researchers highlight that the meaningfulness of goals is not universally defined but rather depends on the reference points chosen. This suggests that without a shared understanding of what constitutes a meaningful goal, the assessment of agency can become arbitrary.

4. **Adaptivity**: The researchers argue that adaptivity is contingent upon the reference class selected for evaluation. This means that a system could be deemed adaptive or non-adaptive based on the criteria established by the observer, further illustrating the frame-dependent nature of agency.

#### Claims Supporting Frame-Dependence
The researchers present four claims that support the notion of frame-dependence in agency:

- **Claim 1**: Individuality is frame-dependent, as the boundaries drawn around a system can vary, affecting the identification of agency.
- **Claim 2**: The source of action is frame-dependent, as different causal variable choices can lead to different conclusions about agency.
- **Claim 3**: Normativity is frame-dependent, as the meaningfulness of goals depends on arbitrary reference points.
- **Claim 4**: Adaptivity is frame-dependent, as the relevance of inputs is determined by the chosen reference class.

These claims collectively reinforce the argument that agency cannot be understood in isolation from the context in which it is evaluated.

#### Philosophical Implications
The researchers argue that the need for frame-dependence in understanding agency suggests that any basic science of agency must account for the context in which agency is evaluated. This has significant implications for fields such as cognitive science, philosophy, and artificial intelligence, as it challenges the notion of agency as a fixed attribute and emphasizes the importance of context in its assessment.

#### Future Directions
The researchers propose that a rigorous mathematical construction of reference frames in the context of agency and reinforcement learning is a promising area for future research. This suggests a
