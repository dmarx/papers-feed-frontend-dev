The decisions made by the researchers in the study regarding image protection against malicious editing using imperceptible perturbations and diffusion models are grounded in a combination of technical considerations, empirical observations, and theoretical frameworks. Below is a detailed technical explanation and rationale for each of the decisions mentioned:

### 1. Decision to Use Imperceptible Perturbations for Image Protection
**Rationale:** The use of imperceptible perturbations is based on the premise that small, carefully crafted noise can disrupt the ability of diffusion models to generate realistic images from protected inputs. This approach aims to maintain the visual integrity of the original image while introducing a layer of security against adversarial edits. The perturbations are designed to be undetectable to the human eye, thus preserving the aesthetic quality of the image while providing a defense mechanism.

### 2. Choice of Diffusion Models for Image Editing
**Rationale:** Diffusion models, particularly those like Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in generating high-quality images from text prompts. Their ability to perform inpainting and editing tasks with minimal user input makes them a significant threat in the context of malicious image manipulation. By focusing on these models, the researchers can evaluate the effectiveness of their protection methods against the most advanced techniques available.

### 3. Selection of JPEG Compression as a Common Attack Vector
**Rationale:** JPEG compression is ubiquitous in digital imaging, making it a realistic and practical attack vector. The researchers recognize that images are often shared and stored in JPEG format, which can inadvertently strip away protective perturbations. By selecting JPEG compression as a focal point, the study addresses a real-world scenario where adversaries might exploit the vulnerabilities of image protection methods.

### 4. Implementation of Encoder and Diffusion Attack Methods
**Rationale:** The encoder and diffusion attack methods are implemented to create two distinct strategies for generating imperceptible perturbations. The encoder attack focuses on manipulating the latent representation of the image, while the diffusion attack directly targets the diffusion process. This dual approach allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the robustness of the perturbations against different types of adversarial strategies.

### 5. Evaluation of Robustness Against JPEG Compression
**Rationale:** Evaluating robustness against JPEG compression is critical because it serves as a litmus test for the effectiveness of the proposed protection methods. The researchers aim to determine how well the perturbations withstand a common image transformation that could be employed by adversaries. This evaluation helps to identify weaknesses in the protection strategy and informs future improvements.

### 6. Consideration of Gaussian and Median Blurs as Potential Defenses
**Rationale:** Gaussian and median blurs are considered as potential defenses because they are common image processing techniques that could theoretically diminish the impact of high-frequency perturbations. By testing these blurs, the researchers can assess whether simple transformations can effectively neutralize the protective measures, thereby gaining insights into the nature of the perturbations.

### 7. Decision to Conduct Experiments Using the Photoguard Repository
**Rationale:** The photoguard repository provides a standardized framework and pre-existing methodologies for testing image protection techniques. Utilizing this repository allows the researchers to build upon established work, ensuring that their experiments are reproducible and comparable to previous studies in the field.

### 8. Choice of Compression Quality Levels for Testing
**Rationale:** The selection of specific JPEG compression quality levels (e.g., 100%, 95%, 85%, 65%) is based on the need to explore a range of scenarios that reflect real-world usage. By examining various quality levels, the researchers can identify thresholds at which the perturbations begin to fail, providing valuable insights into the fragility of the protection methods.

### 9. Assumption About the Effectiveness of Perturbations Against Adaptive Attacks
**Rationale:** The assumption that perturbations can be effective against adaptive attacks stems from the understanding that adversaries may attempt to modify their strategies based on the defenses in place. However, the researchers acknowledge that this is a challenging scenario, as adaptive attackers may develop new techniques to circumvent existing protections.

### 10. Decision to Analyze the Impact of Various Image Transformations
**Rationale:** Analyzing the impact of various image transformations is essential for understanding the robustness of the proposed protection methods. By testing against a range of transformations, the researchers can evaluate how well the perturbations hold up under different conditions, which is crucial for assessing their practical applicability.

### 11. Choice to Focus on High-Stakes Settings for Evaluating Protection Methods
**Rationale:** Focusing on high-stakes settings emphasizes the importance of robust image protection in scenarios where misuse could have significant consequences (e.g., misinformation, deepfakes). This focus helps to highlight the urgency of developing effective defenses against malicious editing and underscores the relevance of the research.

### 12. Decision to Document Limitations of Current Protection Methods Against Adversarial Editing
**Rationale:** Documenting the limitations of current protection methods is vital for transparency and for guiding future research. By acknowledging the weaknesses of their approach, the researchers contribute to a more nuanced
