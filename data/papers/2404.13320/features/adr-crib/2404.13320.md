The decisions made by the researchers in the study "Pixel is a Barrier: Diffusion Models Are More Adversarially Robust Than We Think" reflect a comprehensive understanding of the nuances between pixel-space diffusion models (PDMs) and latent diffusion models (LDMs), as well as the implications of adversarial attacks in the context of image generation and protection. Below are detailed technical explanations and justifications for each of the decisions mentioned:

### 1. Decision to Focus on Pixel-Space Diffusion Models (PDMs) Rather Than Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs)
The researchers chose to focus on PDMs because existing literature predominantly addressed LDMs, leaving a significant gap in understanding the adversarial robustness of PDMs. By investigating PDMs, the researchers aimed to highlight their unique properties and robustness against adversarial attacks, which had been overlooked. The direct manipulation of pixel data in PDMs, as opposed to the latent space in LDMs, allows for a different interaction with adversarial perturbations, making it a critical area of study.

### 2. Choice of Adversarial Attack Methods to Evaluate Against PDMs
The researchers selected adversarial attack methods that were previously effective against LDMs to evaluate their transferability to PDMs. This choice was strategic to demonstrate the robustness of PDMs by showing that established attacks fail when applied in the pixel space. By using these methods, the researchers could effectively illustrate the differences in vulnerability between LDMs and PDMs.

### 3. Assumption That Existing Adversarial Attacks on LDMs Would Not Transfer to PDMs
The assumption was based on the architectural differences between LDMs and PDMs. LDMs utilize an encoder-decoder structure that introduces vulnerabilities in the latent space, while PDMs operate directly in pixel space, which is inherently more robust to certain types of perturbations. This foundational understanding led the researchers to hypothesize that attacks designed for LDMs would not be effective against PDMs.

### 4. Decision to Use PDMs as a Purification Method for Adversarial Perturbations
Given the demonstrated robustness of PDMs against adversarial attacks, the researchers proposed using PDMs as a purification method. This decision was grounded in the idea that PDMs could effectively remove adversarial noise without needing to know the specifics of the attack, thus providing a universal solution to adversarial perturbations.

### 5. Selection of Network Architectures (e.g., U-Net, Transformer) for Experiments
The choice of architectures like U-Net and Transformer was likely influenced by their popularity and effectiveness in image generation tasks. U-Net is known for its strong performance in image-to-image translation tasks, while Transformers have shown promise in various generative tasks. By employing these architectures, the researchers could ensure that their findings were relevant across different model types.

### 6. Choice of Training Datasets for Evaluating PDMs and LDMs
The researchers selected diverse training datasets to ensure that their evaluations were comprehensive and representative of real-world scenarios. This choice was crucial for validating the robustness of PDMs and LDMs across various image types and complexities, thereby enhancing the generalizability of their findings.

### 7. Decision to Analyze Different Input Resolutions in Experiments
Analyzing different input resolutions allowed the researchers to assess the scalability and robustness of PDMs against adversarial attacks at various levels of detail. This decision was important for understanding how resolution impacts the effectiveness of adversarial perturbations and the performance of purification methods.

### 8. Assumption That Adversarial Robustness of PDMs Can Be Generalized Across Various Models
The researchers assumed that the robustness observed in PDMs would extend to various architectures and configurations. This assumption was based on the fundamental properties of pixel-space operations, which are less susceptible to the types of perturbations that exploit latent space vulnerabilities.

### 9. Decision to Propose PDM-Pure as a Universal Purifier
The proposal of PDM-Pure stemmed from the researchers' findings that PDMs could effectively cleanse adversarial perturbations. This decision was motivated by the need for a robust, generalizable solution to protect images from unauthorized editing, leveraging the inherent strengths of PDMs.

### 10. Choice of Performance Metrics for Evaluating the Effectiveness of PDM-Pure
The researchers selected performance metrics that would accurately reflect the effectiveness of PDM-Pure in removing adversarial noise while preserving image quality. This choice was essential for demonstrating the practical utility of their proposed method in real-world applications.

### 11. Decision to Make Code Publicly Available for Reproducibility
Making the code publicly available was a commitment to transparency and reproducibility in research. This decision allows other researchers to validate the findings, build upon the work, and foster collaboration within the community.

### 12. Assumption That Existing Protection Methods Can Be Easily Bypassed by PDM-Based Purification
The researchers posited that existing
