- **Key Insight**: Pixel-space diffusion models (PDMs) exhibit significantly higher adversarial robustness compared to latent diffusion models (LDMs).
  
- **Adversarial Attack Mechanism**: Existing adversarial attacks primarily target LDMs, exploiting their encoder-decoder architecture, which is vulnerable to perturbations.

- **PDMs vs. LDMs**: 
  - LDMs: Perturbations are applied in latent space, leading to larger effective changes in pixel space.
  - PDMs: Operate directly in pixel space, making them less susceptible to adversarial perturbations.

- **Adversarial Loss for LDMs**: 
  - Loss function: 
    \[
    L_{adv}(x) = E_{t,\epsilon} E_{z_t \sim q_t(E_\phi(x))} \|\epsilon_\theta(z_t, t) - \epsilon\|^2_2
    \]
  - Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) for perturbation generation:
    \[
    x^{k+1} = P_{B_\infty}(x_0, \delta) \left( x^k + \eta \text{sign} \nabla_{x^k} L_{adv}(x^k) \right)
    \]

- **PDM-Pure Framework**: 
  - Utilizes PDMs as a universal purifier to remove adversarial patterns.
  - Key requirements:
    1. Perturbations must exhibit out-of-distribution patterns.
    2. The PDM must be robust enough, determined by the training dataset.

- **Purification Process**: 
  - Add small noise to protected images and run the denoising process using PDMs.
  - Example operation:
    \[
    x_t = IF-II(x_{t+1}, x_{64 \times 64}, P)
    \]
  - Resulting image \( x_0 \) should be free of adversarial patterns.

- **Experimental Findings**: 
  - Extensive experiments show that existing adversarial attack methods fail against PDMs.
  - PDMs maintain image integrity better than LDMs under adversarial conditions.

- **Implications for Intellectual Property Protection**: 
  - Current protection methods based on adversarial perturbations can be easily bypassed using PDM-based purification.
  - Calls for a reevaluation of adversarial samples as protection mechanisms for diffusion models.
