  "title": "Pixel is a Barrier: Diffusion Models Are More Adversarially Robust Than\n  We Think",
  "authors": "Haotian Xue, Yongxin Chen",
  "abstract": "Adversarial examples for diffusion models are widely used as solutions for\nsafety concerns. By adding adversarial perturbations to personal images,\nattackers can not edit or imitate them easily. However, it is essential to note\nthat all these protections target the latent diffusion model (LDMs), the\nadversarial examples for diffusion models in the pixel space (PDMs) are largely\noverlooked. This may mislead us to think that the diffusion models are\nvulnerable to adversarial attacks like most deep models. In this paper, we show\nnovel findings that: even though gradient-based white-box attacks can be used\nto attack the LDMs, they fail to attack PDMs. This finding is supported by\nextensive experiments of almost a wide range of attacking methods on various\nPDMs and LDMs with different model structures, which means diffusion models are\nindeed much more robust against adversarial attacks. We also find that PDMs can\nbe used as an off-the-shelf purifier to effectively remove the adversarial\npatterns that were generated on LDMs to protect the images, which means that\nmost protection methods nowadays, to some extent, cannot protect our images\nfrom malicious attacks. We hope that our insights will inspire the community to\nrethink the adversarial samples for diffusion models as protection methods and\nmove forward to more effective protection.
