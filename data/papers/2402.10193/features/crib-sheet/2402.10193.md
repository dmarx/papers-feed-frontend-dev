- **BitDelta Overview**: A post-fine-tuning method that quantizes the delta between fine-tuned and base models to 1 bit, significantly reducing memory requirements and improving serving efficiency.

- **Delta Decomposition**: The weight delta is defined as \( \Delta = W_{\text{fine}} - W_{\text{base}} \). This delta can be compressed while maintaining performance.

- **1-Bit Quantization**: 
  - The quantization process is represented as:
    \[
    \Delta = \alpha \odot \text{Sign}(\Delta)
    \]
    where \( \text{Sign}(W_{ij}) = +1 \) if \( W_{ij} > 0 \) and \( -1 \) if \( W_{ij} \leq 0 \).
  - The scaling factor \( \alpha \) is initialized to minimize quantization error:
    \[
    \alpha = \frac{1}{nm} \sum_{ij} |\Delta_{ij}|
    \]

- **Scale Distillation**: 
  - Further optimizes the scaling factor \( \alpha \) by minimizing the difference between logits of the quantized and original models:
    \[
    \alpha^* = \arg \min_\alpha E_{x \sim X} \|Z_{\text{fine}}(x) - Z_{\text{bin}}(x; \alpha)\|^2
    \]
  - Uses a calibration dataset (C4) for distillation.

- **Efficiency Gains**: 
  - BitDelta reduces GPU memory requirements by over 10× compared to full-precision fine-tuned models.
  - Latency improvements in multi-tenant settings due to reduced memory consumption.

- **Methodology Cost**: 
  - Requires training only a single parameter per weight matrix, significantly less than full fine-tuning methods.
  - Operates efficiently with shorter input sequences (length 128) and requires only 200 training steps.

- **Implications for Multi-Tenant Serving**: 
  - Enables a single high-precision base model to serve multiple fine-tuned models with 1-bit deltas, optimizing GPU resource usage.
  - Facilitates model hot-swapping, allowing dynamic loading of deltas based on requests.

- **Experimental Validation**: 
  - Tested on Llama-2, Mistral, and MPT model families, demonstrating minimal performance degradation across models with up to 70B parameters.

- **Comparison with Existing Methods**: 
  - BitDelta offers a simpler and faster alternative to existing delta compression techniques, achieving a compression ratio of over 10× while being compatible with modern accelerators.
