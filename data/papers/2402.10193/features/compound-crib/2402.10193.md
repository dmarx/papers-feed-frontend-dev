### Detailed Technical Explanations and Justifications for BitDelta

#### 1. BitDelta Overview
BitDelta is a novel post-fine-tuning method that quantizes the delta between fine-tuned and base models to just 1 bit. This approach is motivated by the observation that fine-tuning typically adds less new information compared to the extensive pre-training phase. By focusing on the delta, BitDelta significantly reduces memory requirements and enhances serving efficiency, making it particularly suitable for scenarios where multiple fine-tuned models need to be served concurrently.

#### 2. Delta Decomposition
The weight delta is defined as:
\[
\Delta = W_{\text{fine}} - W_{\text{base}}
\]
This formulation allows for a clear separation of the modifications introduced during fine-tuning from the base model's weights. The rationale behind this decomposition is that the delta, which represents the changes made to adapt the model to specific tasks, can often be compressed without substantial loss in performance. This insight is crucial for reducing the storage and memory overhead associated with maintaining multiple fine-tuned models.

#### 3. 1-Bit Quantization
The quantization process is expressed as:
\[
\Delta = \alpha \odot \text{Sign}(\Delta)
\]
where \( \text{Sign}(W_{ij}) = +1 \) if \( W_{ij} > 0 \) and \( -1 \) if \( W_{ij} \leq 0 \). This method effectively reduces the representation of the delta to a binary format, where the sign indicates the direction of the weight change, and \( \alpha \) serves as a scaling factor that adjusts the magnitude of the delta.

The scaling factor \( \alpha \) is initialized to minimize quantization error:
\[
\alpha = \frac{1}{nm} \sum_{ij} |\Delta_{ij}|
\]
This initialization is critical as it provides a starting point that aims to preserve the overall structure of the delta while minimizing the loss of information during quantization. The choice of using the mean absolute value of the deltas ensures that the scaling factor is representative of the typical magnitude of changes introduced by fine-tuning.

#### 4. Scale Distillation
To further refine the scaling factor \( \alpha \), the researchers employ a technique called scale distillation, which optimizes \( \alpha \) by minimizing the difference between the logits of the quantized and original models:
\[
\alpha^* = \arg \min_\alpha E_{x \sim X} \|Z_{\text{fine}}(x) - Z_{\text{bin}}(x; \alpha)\|^2
\]
This process leverages a calibration dataset (C4) to ensure that the quantized model's outputs closely match those of the fine-tuned model. The robustness of this method lies in its ability to adapt the scaling factor based on the actual performance of the model, rather than relying solely on theoretical error metrics.

#### 5. Efficiency Gains
BitDelta achieves over a 10× reduction in GPU memory requirements compared to full-precision fine-tuned models. This reduction is particularly beneficial in multi-tenant environments where multiple models are served simultaneously. The decreased memory footprint translates directly into lower latency during inference, as the GPU can handle more requests concurrently without being bottlenecked by memory constraints.

#### 6. Methodology Cost
The methodology cost of BitDelta is significantly lower than that of full fine-tuning methods. It requires training only a single parameter per weight matrix, in stark contrast to the thousands or millions of parameters typically involved in full fine-tuning. Additionally, BitDelta operates efficiently with shorter input sequences (length 128) and requires only 200 training steps, making it a highly efficient alternative to traditional fine-tuning approaches.

#### 7. Implications for Multi-Tenant Serving
BitDelta's ability to compress deltas to 1 bit allows a single high-precision base model to serve multiple fine-tuned models. This capability optimizes GPU resource usage and facilitates model hot-swapping, where deltas can be dynamically loaded based on incoming requests. This flexibility is crucial for applications that require rapid adaptation to varying user needs without incurring significant overhead.

#### 8. Experimental Validation
The effectiveness of BitDelta has been validated through experiments on various model families, including Llama-2, Mistral, and MPT, demonstrating minimal performance degradation even for models with up to 70 billion parameters. This empirical evidence supports the claim that the method can maintain high performance while achieving substantial memory savings.

#### 9. Comparison with Existing Methods
BitDelta stands out as a simpler and faster alternative to existing delta compression techniques. It achieves a compression ratio of over 10× while remaining compatible with modern accelerators, making it an attractive option for developers looking to optimize model storage and serving efficiency.

### Conclusion
In summary, BitDelta represents a significant advancement in the efficient serving of fine-tuned models. By quantizing the delta to
