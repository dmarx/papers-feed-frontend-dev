The decisions made by researchers in the study of the limiting dynamics of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in deep neural networks are grounded in a combination of theoretical insights, empirical observations, and the need for a comprehensive understanding of the optimization process. Below is a detailed technical explanation and rationale for each of the decisions listed:

### 1. Decision to Explore the Limiting Dynamics of SGD in Deep Neural Networks
The exploration of limiting dynamics is crucial for understanding how neural networks behave after convergence. Researchers aim to uncover the underlying mechanisms that govern the optimization process, particularly in the context of deep learning, where traditional optimization theories may not apply. By studying these dynamics, researchers can identify factors that influence model performance and generalization, leading to better training practices.

### 2. Choice of Using Stochastic Gradient Descent as the Optimization Method
SGD is widely used in training deep neural networks due to its efficiency and effectiveness in handling large datasets. The stochastic nature of SGD allows for faster convergence and the ability to escape local minima, making it a suitable choice for exploring the dynamics of neural network training. Additionally, SGD's inherent noise introduces interesting stochastic properties that can be modeled mathematically.

### 3. Selection of a Modified Loss Function for Analysis
The modified loss function is essential for capturing the effects of regularization and the dynamics of the optimization process. By using a modified loss, researchers can analyze how the optimization landscape changes during training and how it influences the trajectory of the parameters in the parameter space. This approach helps in understanding the role of regularization in controlling the dynamics of SGD.

### 4. Decision to Model SGD as an Underdamped Langevin Equation
Modeling SGD as an underdamped Langevin equation allows researchers to incorporate both deterministic and stochastic components of the optimization process. This framework provides a physical interpretation of the dynamics, where the parameters are treated as particles moving in a potential landscape influenced by noise. This model captures the oscillatory behavior observed in the parameter updates and provides insights into the convergence properties of SGD.

### 5. Choice of Linear Regression as a Fundamental Setting for Theoretical Exploration
Linear regression serves as a fundamental and well-understood setting that simplifies the analysis of SGD dynamics. It allows researchers to derive exact analytical expressions for the behavior of the optimization process, making it easier to identify key factors influencing the dynamics. This foundational approach provides a basis for extending insights to more complex neural network architectures.

### 6. Assumption of Gaussian Noise in Gradient Estimates
Assuming Gaussian noise in gradient estimates is a common practice in stochastic optimization. This assumption simplifies the analysis and allows researchers to leverage the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sum of a large number of independent random variables tends toward a Gaussian distribution. This assumption is crucial for deriving the stochastic differential equations that model the dynamics of SGD.

### 7. Decision to Derive a Continuous-Time Model for SGD
Deriving a continuous-time model for SGD enables researchers to analyze the dynamics in a more tractable mathematical framework. Continuous-time models facilitate the use of tools from stochastic calculus, such as the Fokker-Planck equation, to study the evolution of probability distributions over time. This approach provides deeper insights into the limiting behavior of the optimization process.

### 8. Choice of Fokker-Planck Equation to Analyze Phase Space Dynamics
The Fokker-Planck equation is a powerful tool for studying the time evolution of probability distributions in stochastic systems. By applying this equation, researchers can analyze the phase space dynamics of the parameters and their velocities, providing a comprehensive understanding of how the optimization process evolves over time. This analysis helps in identifying stationary distributions and understanding the long-term behavior of SGD.

### 9. Decision to Study the Influence of Hyperparameters on Limiting Dynamics
Hyperparameters play a critical role in the performance of SGD and the resulting model. By studying their influence on limiting dynamics, researchers can identify optimal configurations that enhance convergence and generalization. This exploration is essential for developing a theoretical framework that connects hyperparameters to the observed behavior of neural networks.

### 10. Choice of ResNet-18 Model for Empirical Validation
ResNet-18 is a well-established architecture that has demonstrated strong performance on various tasks. Using this model for empirical validation allows researchers to test their theoretical predictions in a practical setting. The choice of a widely recognized architecture also facilitates comparisons with existing literature and enhances the credibility of the findings.

### 11. Decision to Analyze Anomalous Diffusion in Parameter Space
Analyzing anomalous diffusion provides insights into the non-standard behavior of parameter updates in SGD. This exploration helps researchers understand how the network continues to move through parameter space even after convergence, revealing the intricate dynamics that influence model performance. The study of anomalous diffusion is crucial for developing a comprehensive theory of SGD.

### 12. Assumption of Spatial Independence in Gradient Noise Covariance
Assuming spatial independence in gradient noise covariance simplifies the analysis and allows for a clearer understanding of the dynamics. This assumption is reasonable in many practical scenarios and enables researchers to derive analytical results that capture the essential features of the
