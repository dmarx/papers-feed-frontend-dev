The research on the limiting dynamics of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in deep neural networks presents a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex interactions between optimization hyperparameters, gradient noise, and the underlying geometry of the loss landscape. Below, I provide detailed technical explanations and justifications for the key decisions made by the researchers in this study.

### 1. Anomalous Diffusion in SGD

**Justification**: The observation that networks trained with SGD exhibit anomalous diffusion, characterized by a power-law relationship between the distance traveled in parameter space and the number of gradient updates, is significant. The nontrivial exponent \( c \) indicates that the dynamics of parameter updates are not simply linear (as in standard Brownian motion) but instead reflect a more complex underlying process. This behavior suggests that the optimization landscape is rugged, with varying local minima and barriers that affect the trajectory of the parameters. The power-law relationship implies that the network continues to explore the parameter space even after convergence, which can lead to improved generalization and robustness.

### 2. Continuous-Time Model

**Justification**: The decision to model the dynamics of SGD as an underdamped Langevin equation is rooted in the need to capture both the deterministic and stochastic aspects of the optimization process. The inclusion of finite learning rates and stochastic gradient noise allows for a more accurate representation of the training dynamics. The Langevin framework provides a natural way to incorporate noise and friction, which are inherent in SGD due to the random sampling of mini-batches. This continuous-time model facilitates the analysis of the system's behavior over time and allows for the derivation of meaningful statistical properties.

### 3. Modified Loss Function

**Justification**: The introduction of a modified loss function that regularizes velocity is crucial for understanding the dynamics of SGD. By breaking detailed balance, the modified loss leads to non-zero probability currents in phase space, which are essential for capturing the oscillatory behavior observed in the parameter updates. This modification reflects the reality that the optimization process is not solely driven by the original loss function but is influenced by the dynamics of the system itself. The regularization of velocity helps to stabilize the updates and can prevent overfitting by encouraging exploration of the parameter space.

### 4. Hessian Matrix Influence

**Justification**: The interaction between hyperparameters, gradient noise structure, and the Hessian matrix is pivotal for understanding the limiting dynamics of SGD. The Hessian provides information about the curvature of the loss landscape, which directly affects the behavior of the optimization process. By analyzing how these factors interact, the researchers can derive insights into the stability and convergence properties of the training dynamics. This understanding is essential for designing better optimization algorithms and for tuning hyperparameters effectively.

### 5. Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process

**Justification**: The identification of the dynamics of SGD with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in the context of linear regression allows for the derivation of exact analytical expressions for the system's behavior. The OU process is well-studied in statistical physics and provides a framework for understanding the interplay between deterministic drift and stochastic diffusion. This connection enables the researchers to leverage existing results from the theory of stochastic processes to gain insights into the behavior of SGD in more complex settings.

### 6. Covariance Structure Assumption

**Justification**: The assumption that the covariance of the gradient noise is spatially independent and proportional to the Hessian is a strong yet reasonable simplification. This assumption allows for a tractable analysis of the dynamics while capturing the essential features of the optimization process. By relating the gradient noise to the Hessian, the researchers can better understand how the noise affects the trajectory of the parameters and the overall convergence behavior.

### 7. Empirical Validation

**Justification**: The empirical validation of the theoretical predictions using a ResNet-18 model trained on ImageNet is a critical step in establishing the robustness of the proposed framework. By demonstrating that the predicted qualitative characteristics hold true in practice, the researchers provide strong evidence for the validity of their theoretical model. This validation is essential for building confidence in the proposed explanations and for encouraging further exploration of the dynamics of SGD.

### 8. Hyperparameter Effects

**Justification**: The quantitative derivation of the influence of learning rate, batch size, and momentum coefficient on the dynamics of SGD is crucial for practical applications. By providing explicit relationships between these hyperparameters and the anomalous diffusion exponent, the researchers equip practitioners with actionable insights for tuning their models. This understanding can lead to improved training efficiency and model performance.

### 9. Power Law Relationship

**Justification**: The observation that the squared norm of global displacement continues to grow monotonically, even after performance convergence, highlights the ongoing exploration of the parameter space. This finding is significant as it suggests that the optimization process does not simply halt upon reaching a local minimum but continues to evolve, potentially leading to better generalization. The power law relationship reinforces the notion of anomalous diffusion and provides a framework for understanding the long-term behavior of SGD.
