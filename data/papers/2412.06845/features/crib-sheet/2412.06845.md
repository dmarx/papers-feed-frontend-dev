- **Moxin 7B Overview**
  - Fully open-source LLM developed under the Model Openness Framework (MOF).
  - Achieves highest MOF classification level: "open science."
  - Comprehensive release includes pre-training code, configurations, datasets, and checkpoints.

- **Model Openness Framework (MOF)**
  - Systematic ranking classification for AI models based on completeness and openness.
  - Promotes transparency, reproducibility, and combats "openwashing."

- **Performance Metrics**
  - Superior performance in zero-shot evaluation compared to popular 7B models.
  - Competitive performance in few-shot evaluation.
  - Outperforms 7B baselines like Llama2-7B-chat.

- **Model Architecture**
  - Extended Mistral model architecture with 36 blocks.
  - Utilizes grouped-query attention (GQA) and sliding window attention (SWA) for efficiency.
  - GQA reduces memory requirements and accelerates inference speed.
  - Incorporates a rolling buffer cache for managing long sequences.

- **Training Data Sources**
  - Text data from SlimPajama and DCLM-BASELINE.
  - SlimPajama: cleaned and deduplicated version of RedPajama, reducing 49.6% of bytes.
  - DCLM-BASELINE: derived from CommonCrawl, employs MinHash for deduplication.

- **Data Curation Techniques**
  - Filtering by language, heuristic-based filtering, quality filtering, data deduplication, and data mixing.
  - Deduplication using MinHashLSH with a Jaccard similarity threshold of 0.8.

- **Open-source Datasets**
  - C4 (160B tokens), The Pile (300B tokens), RefinedWeb (600B tokens), Dolma (3T tokens), FineWeb (15T tokens), RedPajama-v2 (30T tokens).
  - Domain-specific datasets: StackV2 (900B tokens), FineWeb-Edu (1.3T tokens).

- **Tokenization Techniques**
  - Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) and SentencePiece for different language processing.
  - OpenAI's tiktoken tokenizer as a notable implementation.

- **Training Strategies**
  - Mixture of Experts (MoE) training for enhancing smaller model performance.
