  "abstract": "Protecting personal data against exploitation of machine learning models is\ncrucial. Recently, availability attacks have shown great promise to provide an\nextra layer of protection against the unauthorized use of data to train neural\nnetworks. These methods aim to add imperceptible noise to clean data so that\nthe neural networks cannot extract meaningful patterns from the protected data,\nclaiming that they can make personal data \"unexploitable.\" This paper provides\na strong countermeasure against such approaches, showing that unexploitable\ndata might only be an illusion. In particular, we leverage the power of\ndiffusion models and show that a carefully designed denoising process can\ncounteract the effectiveness of the data-protecting perturbations. We\nrigorously analyze our algorithm, and theoretically prove that the amount of\nrequired denoising is directly related to the magnitude of the data-protecting\nperturbations. Our approach, called AVATAR, delivers state-of-the-art\nperformance against a suite of recent availability attacks in various\nscenarios, outperforming adversarial training even under distribution mismatch\nbetween the diffusion model and the protected data. Our findings call for more\nresearch into making personal data unexploitable, showing that this goal is far\nfrom over. Our implementation is available at this repository:\nhttps://github.com/hmdolatabadi/AVATAR.",
