# The Devil's Advocate: Shattering the Illusion of Unexploitable Data using Diffusion Models

## Abstract

## 

Protecting personal data against exploitation of machine learning models is crucial. Recently, availability attacks have shown great promise to provide an extra layer of protection against the unauthorized use of data to train neural networks. These methods aim to add imperceptible noise to clean data so that the neural networks cannot extract meaningful patterns from the protected data, claiming that they can make personal data "unexploitable." This paper provides a strong countermeasure against such approaches, showing that unexploitable data might only be an illusion. In particular, we leverage the power of diffusion models and show that a carefully designed denoising process can counteract the effectiveness of the dataprotecting perturbations. We rigorously analyze our algorithm, and theoretically prove that the amount of required denoising is directly related to the magnitude of the data-protecting perturbations. Our approach, called AVATAR, delivers state-ofthe-art performance against a suite of recent availability attacks in various scenarios, outperforming adversarial training even under distribution mismatch between the diffusion model and the protected data.

## I. INTRODUCTION

Neural networks have achieved great success in various areas of computer vision including object detection [[25,](#b24)[14]](#b13), semantic segmentation [[78,](#b77)[36]](#b35), and photo-realistic image/video generation [[31,](#b30)[11,](#b10)[54]](#b53). While the efforts of the community in the development of such models cannot be undermined, this unparalleled success would have been impossible without the abundance of data resources available today [[9,](#b8)[33,](#b32)[49,](#b48)[35]](#b34). In this regard, social media, and the internet in general, provides a platform that can be crawled easily to create massive datasets. This capability can act both as a blessing and a curse: while the collected data can facilitate learning larger, more accurate neural networks, the users lose control over protecting their personal data from being exploited. This issue has raised increasing concerns about misuse of personal data [[27,](#b26)[26,](#b25)[5]](#b4).

Recently, there has been an increasing number of studies on hindering the unauthorized use of personal data for neural network image classifiers [[15,](#b14)[30,](#b29)[72,](#b71)[17,](#b16)[18,](#b17)[71,](#b70)[62,](#b61)[50]](#b49).

These methods tend to add an imperceptible amount of noise to the clean images so that while the data has the same appearance as the ground-truth, it cannot provide any meaningful patterns for the neural networks to learn. As a result, such approaches, collectively known as availability attacks [[4]](#b3), claim that personal image data can be made unexploitable for the neural networks [[30,](#b29)[71]](#b70). While there has been an abundance of research on designing better availability attacks, far too little attention has been paid to counter-attacks that might be employed by adversaries to break such precautionary measures.

Unfortunately, the assumptions of existing availability attacks are far too weak to make the data unexploitable. For example, consider a user who shares their protected photos over their social media. We can clearly see that once the photos are shared, they cannot be protected against all future countermeasures [[47]](#b46). For instance, consider a corporate entity that aims to train face recognition models by crawling over social media without the consent of the users. While this unauthorized entity might not have unprotected versions of a particular person's image from his/her social media, they can have a large pre-trained model representing a facial image distribution. Given this threat model, shown in Figure [1](#), we aim to show that counteracting the protecting perturbations is indeed plausible.

To this end, we show that pre-trained density estimators are powerful tools that can be used to counteract the effects of the data-protecting perturbations, eventually enabling us to exploit protected data. We utilize the power of diffusion models in representing the image data distributions to show that reverse-engineering unexploitable data is easier than what is thought. In particular, given a training dataset, we first diffuse the images by adding a controlled amount of Gaussian noise following the forward process of a pre-trained diffusion model. Then, we denoise the noisy images using the reverse process of the aforementioned model, resulting in a dataset purified from data-protecting perturbations. Theoretically, using contraction properties of stochastic difference equations we prove that the number of diffusion steps required to cancel the data-protecting perturbations is directly influenced by the

Availability attacks cannot guarantee to protect all the data that exists over the web. A data exploiter might use large density estimators to defuse the data-protecting perturbations and exploit the data. magnitude of its norm. Thus, protecting personal data using imperceptible perturbations is not possible. We also empirically show that our approach is surprisingly powerful, being able to deliver the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance against a wide variety of recent availability attacks. Our findings indicate the fragility of unexploitable data, calling for more research to protect personal data.

Diffusion models have been extensively used in various areas. Closely related to our work, Yoon et al. [[70]](#b69) and Nie et al. [[42]](#b41) have employed diffusion models to increase robustness against adversarial attacks. In contrast to these methods, in this paper, we investigate the capabilities of diffusion models as a threat against personal data protected by availability attacks. In particular, we leverage the SOTA diffusion models as a proxy for the true data distribution and argue why unlearnable examples provide a false sense of data privacy.

Our contributions can be summarized as follows:

• We introduce AVATAR as a countermeasure against data availability attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explores the use of diffusion models to circumvent such attacks. • We show the power of AVATAR in breaking availability attacks over five datasets, four architectures, and seven of the most recent availability attacks. AVATAR achieves the SOTA performance against availability attacks, outperforming adversarial training. • Our results indicate that even in the absence of the true data distribution, one can use a similar distribution to counteract availability attacks. • Theoretically, we show that the amount of noise needed to diffuse the data-protecting perturbation is directly related to the magnitude of its norm. This result indicates that achieving both goals of availability attacks (data utility and protection) at the same time is impossible.

## II. RELATED WORK

In this section, we review the related work to our approach. a) Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks: A considerable number of studies have been published on various types of data poisoning attacks [[4,](#b3)[51,](#b50)[20]](#b19). These attacks aim to pollute the training data so that they can hinder the performance of the machine learning model at test-time [[3,](#b2)[32,](#b31)[40]](#b39). While these methods are quite successful in achieving this goal, they often tend to perform weakly against neural networks [[40]](#b39) and appear to be distinguishable from the clean samples, damaging the utility of the underlying data [[68]](#b67). Backdoor attacks are a popular family of data poisonings against deep neural networks [[23,](#b22)[2,](#b1)[63,](#b62)[12]](#b11). Unlike general poisoning attacks, these methods attach triggers to a small fraction of the clean training data so that the model creates an association between the existence of the trigger and a particular class. During inference, the neural network would behave normally on benign samples. However, if the trigger is activated, the model would output the attacker's desired value due to the existence of a backdoor in the model.

b) Availability Attacks: Motivated to address the lack of personal data privacy, an emerging type of poisoning attacks known as availability attacks have drawn considerable attention. Unlike previous types of poisoning attacks, availability attacks seek to add imperceptible perturbations to the clean training data with two goals in mind. First, the added perturbation should be able to protect the underlying data from being exploited by a neural network during training. Second, the perturbed data should still preserve its normal utility. To understand these constraints, consider a user sharing their photo over their social media. While the user wants to protect their photo from unauthorized use of web-crawlers to train a face recognition model [[27]](#b26) (first constraint), they still wish their photo to appear normal to their audience (second constraint) [[30]](#b29).

Feng et al. [[15]](#b14) propose to produce the poisoning perturbations by training an auto-encoder, whose aim is to get the lowest performance from an auxiliary classifier. In a similar spirit, Tian et al. [[62]](#b61) train a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) [[21]](#b20) to generate the availability attacks' perturbation. The training objective is designed to create a spurious correlation between the noisy image and the ground-truth labels. Concurrently, Yu et al. [[71]](#b70) empirically investigate various types of availability attacks and show that almost all of them leverage these spurious features to create a shortcut within neural networks [[19]](#b18). Yu et al. [[71]](#b70) then propose a fast and scalable approach for perturbation generation by generating randomly-initialized linearly-separable perturbations which can generate availability attacks for an entire dataset in a few seconds. Concurrently, Sandoval-Segura et al. [[50]](#b49) proposed another approach that generates the random noise independent from the data. In this approach, first the beginning rows and columns of each channel are populated with Gaussian noise. Then, an autoregressive process is used to find the value of the remaining pixel values.

Another popular approach to generate availability attacks is via direct optimization. Huang et al. [[30]](#b29) define a bi-level optimization objective to generate error-minimizing noise for data samples and an auxiliary classifier. It is argued that since the perturbed images minimize the auxiliary classifier's loss, they contain no useful information for any other target classifier to learn, and as such, the model would not exploit them during training. In contrast, Fowl et al. [[17]](#b16) show that using adversarial examples [[60,](#b59)[22]](#b21) as the poisoned data would make it hard for the classifier to learn any meaningful pattern, and thus, they can serve as a powerful family of availability attacks. While optimization-based availability attacks are potent, they are often computationally demanding and several attempts have been made to ease their computational burden [[16,](#b15)[76]](#b75).

Compared to various types of availability attacks, preventative measures have received little attention. It has been shown that various data augmentation techniques (such as CutOut [[10]](#b9), Mixup [[75]](#b74), CutMix [[73]](#b72), and Fast Autoaugment [[34]](#b33)) are not able to prevent availability attacks [[30,](#b29)[17,](#b16)[62,](#b61)[71]](#b70). Tao et al. [[61]](#b60) show that adversarial training [[39,](#b38)[77,](#b76)[13]](#b12), originally proposed to enhance robustness against adversarial attacks [[60,](#b59)[22]](#b21), can be used to train successful classifiers against availability attacks. Later, Fu et al. [[18]](#b17) extended the error-minimizing noise of Huang et al. [[30]](#b29) resulting in perturbations that can even prevent adversarial training from learning over the poisoned data. Despite this, adversarial training has remained one of the strongest defense baselines against availability attacks. In this work, we show that one can outperform adversarial training in an attempt to counteract availability attacks. c) Diffusion Models: Denoising diffusion probabilistic modeling (DDPM) [[55,](#b54)[28]](#b27) (also known as score-matching networks [[56]](#b55)[[57]](#b56)[[58]](#b57)) are a family of deep generative models that have achieved the SOTA performance in image [[11,](#b10)[67]](#b66), text-to-image [[48]](#b47), video [[54]](#b53), and 3D-object [[46]](#b45) generation. Diffusion models generally comprise of a forward and a backward process [[8]](#b7). In the forward process, the model gradually adds noise to the data until it is transformed into Gaussian noise. The backward process is the reverse of the forward process, where the model tries to gradually transform/denoise a Gaussian vector into a data point.

## III. PROPOSED METHOD

This section formally introduces our proposed method, called AVATAR (dAta aVailAbiliTy Attacks defuseR). First, we define our notation and problem settings. Next, we introduce our proposed approach that materializes our threat model and provide a theoretical analysis of our framework. Finally, we discuss the potential advantages of AVATAR compared to existing methods such as adversarial training.

## A. Problem Statement

Let D = {(x (i) , y (i) )} n i=1 be a labeled dataset consisting of n i.i.d. samples x (i) each with a label y (i) . Without loss of generality, in this paper, we consider image data x (i) ∈ R d where d shows the data dimension. Also, we assume that y (i) takes one of the K possible class values {1, 2, . . . , K}. Furthermore, let f θ : R d → R K denote a neural network classifier parameterized by θ that takes an image x and outputs a realvalued vector z = f θ (x) known as the logit. The final decision of the classifier is determined via ŷ = arg max j z j . To train the classifier, one usually aims to minimize the empirical error between the ground-truth labels and the classifier predictions:

$arg min θ E (x,y)∈D [ℓ(f θ (x), y)],(1)$where ℓ(•) denotes the cross-entropy loss. Following the convention in availability attacks, we assume that there exists a data curator that manipulates the dataset D into D pr = {(x (i) , y (i) )} n i=1 such that once a neural network is trained over D pr , it performs poorly over the clean data D:

$arg max Dpr E (x,y)∈D [ℓ(f θ * (x), y)] s.t. θ * = arg min θ E (x,y)∈Dpr [ℓ(f θ (x), y)].(2)$Since each image x(i) needs to maintain its normal utility, it is assumed that x(i) = x (i) + δ (i) . Here, δ (i) 's are the dataprotecting perturbations such that δ (i) p ≤ ε, where ∥•∥ p denotes the L p norm.

## B. dAta aVailAbiliTy Attacks defuseR (AVATAR)

As discussed, large pre-trained generative models can pose a threat to availability attacks and personal data protection. In this section, we show how diffusion models, which are the SOTA in image generation, can be leveraged to cancel out the effects of availability attacks.

Recall that availability attacks provide a manipulated version of the original data x that is seemingly unexploitable. At the same time, the protected image x = x + δ should have its normal utility as it is going to be used by the users, e.g., to post over their social media. This condition reflects itself through the constraint that ∥δ∥ p ≤ ε.

A trivial idea would be to add random noise to the protected perturbation that might counteract the perturbation, but this is detrimental/ineffective in removing the unlearnable effect [[30]](#b29).

As such, we propose to use a diffusion model for denoising as outlined next. [1](#foot_0)Specifically, let us assume that we have a pre-trained DDPM [[28]](#b27) model that represents the data distribution x 0 ∼ p data (x). The forward process of this model is represented using a Markov chain of length T , such that:

$xt = 1 -βtxt-1 + βtϵt,(3)$where ϵ t ∼ N (0, I) is the normal distribution, and t = 1, 2, . . . , T . The constants β t , known as variance schedules, are selected such that x T ∼ N (0, I). If we set α t := t s=1 (1 -β s ), then this Markov process can also be performed via a single step [[28]](#b27):

$xt = √ αtx0 + √ 1 -αtϵ.(4)$The reverse of this process is also a variational Markov chain which is represented by:

$xt-1 = 1 √ 1 -βt (xt + βts ϕ (xt, t)) + βtϵt.(5)$Here, s ϕ (•, t) is a network parameterized by ϕ representing the score of the noisy data distribution at scale t.

To cancel the effects of the data-protecting perturbations, we propose to first add Gaussian noise to the data. The amount of noise should be adjusted in a way that each image maintains its visual appearance. Otherwise, the semantic information of each image would be lost, and since the reverse process is probabilistic, the original image might not be recovered. In particular, let x be a protected image. We perform the forward process up to a step t * < T such that the semantic information of the image is preserved:

$xt * = √ αt * x + √ 1 -αt * ϵ.(6)$Now, we have managed to diminish the effects of the dataprotecting perturbation in x t * . However, this way we would also damage the semantic features of the data which makes it hard to train a neural network model (see the ablation study in Figure [4](#fig_2)). To revert to the normal image space, we use the reverse process of our diffusion model to denoise the data:

$xt-1 = 1 √ 1 -βt (xt + βts ϕ (xt, t)) + βtϵt.(7)$Recursively solving Equation ( [7](#formula_6)) from t * to 1, we get a denoised version of the data which we denote by x = x0 . Using this process, , shown in Figure [2](#fig_0), we unlock the entire dataset D pr , and construct a new one D de = {(x (i) , y (i) )} for neural network training. Algorithm 1 shows our final algorithm for training a neural network using AVATAR.

## C. Conflicting Assumptions in Availability Attacks

So far, we discussed how by using diffusion models we can nullify the effects of the data-protecting perturbations. Here, we take a theoretical perspective on our proposed solution and show that in this setting, the two constraints of availability attacks conflict with each other. Specifically, from the perspective of availability attacks our result indicates that for a better data protection against AVATAR, we need larger perturbation norms. However, enlarging the perturbation is in Algorithm 1 dAta aVailAbiliTy Attacks defuseR

end for 15: end for conflict with retaining data utility which is the ultimate aim of availability attacks as discussed in Section III-B. Theorem 1. Let x ∈ R d denote a clean image and x = x + δ its protected version, where δ denotes any arbitrary data protection perturbation. Also, let x0 be the sanitized image using the AVATAR denoising process given in Equations ( [6](#formula_5)) and [(7)](#b6). If we set t * such that

$2 log 2 ∥δ∥ 2 + 4d µ∆ ≤ t * βt * ≤ µ∆ 4d ,$then the estimation error between the sanitized x0 and clean image x can be bounded as:

$E ∥x0 -x∥ 2 ≤ 2(µ + 1)∆,$where ∆ = E[∥x0 -x∥ 2 ] and µ > 0 is a constant.

Proof. See Appendix A for our proof using the contraction property of stochastic difference equations.

Theorem 1 states that for a protected image with a larger perturbation norm ∥δ∥, a larger amount of noise (determined by t * β t * ) is required. However, the amount of noise cannot be arbitrarily large as the semantic information of the image might be lost in the process (as indicated by the presence of ∆ in the upper-bound).

## D. AVATAR vs. Adversarial Training

As Tao et al. [[61]](#b60) have demonstrated, adversarial training (AT) [[39]](#b38) could also be used to train successful models over unexploitable data. However, our approach has several key advantages compared to AT:

1) First, AT modifies the learning algorithm, and as such, it needs to be applied separately for training each neural network. In contrast, AVATAR sanitizes the data only once. As a result, AVATAR is more efficient. 2) Second, as shown by Tsipras et al. [[64]](#b63), AT greatly affects the clean accuracy in its learning process, and as such, might not be the ultimate method for defending against availability attacks. 3) Lastly, as Fu et al. [[18]](#b17) show, one can build unexploitable data against AT that would essentially render AT vulnerable to availability attacks. However, to the best of our knowledge, no adaptive availability attacks have been proposed against diffusion models so far.

## IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

In this section, we run various experiments to analyze the performance of AVATAR against availability attacks:

1) We conduct extensive experiments on seven SOTA availability attacks and show that given the data distribution, AVATAR can counteract them (Section IV-B). 2) We provide detailed comparisons against various preprocessing techniques (Section IV-C), early stopping (Section IV-D), and adversarial training (Section IV-E) to show that AVATAR delivers the best performance. 3) We provide extensive ablation studies into different assumptions made by AVATAR. First, we show that the training data overlap between the diffusion model and the unlearnable example generation has no effect on the performance of AVATAR (Section IV-G). Interestingly, we show that even a similar, different, or even poisoned distribution compared to the true data distribution can counteract availability attacks (Section IV-H). 4) We simulate our scenario given in Figure [1](#) for the real-world application of facial recognition to show the plausibility of our approach. Again, here we use a diffusion model trained on a different dataset, but we manage to counteract the unlearnable examples for another dataset (Section IV-I). We also include an extended version of our experimental results in Appendix B.

## A. Details of Experimental Settings

In this section, we provide the details of our experimental settings.

a) Datasets: In our experiments, we use four different datasets. CIFAR-10 & 100 [[33]](#b32) are 32×32 datasets of colored images, where the classes contain different objects, animals, plants, etc. SVHN [[41]](#b40) is a dataset of house numbers from 0 to 9 in a natural, street view setting. Finally, ImageNet [[49]](#b48) is a dataset of natural images of size 224 × 224 with 1000 classes. In our experiments, we use two simplified versions of this dataset. First, following the convention of prior research, we select the first 100 classes of this dataset, which we refer to as ImageNet (IN)-100. Second, for our distribution mismatch experiments, we follow Huang et al. [[30]](#b29) and select 10 classes of ImageNet that are closely aligned with CIFAR-10 and downscale them to 32×32 size. We call this dataset IN-10. The information on the selected classes can be found in Table [I](#). Finally, we also use the 32×32 version of the ImageNet dataset for some of our experiments, which we denote by IN-1k-32×32.

b) Classifiers: In our experiments, we use four types of neural network image classifiers, namely: ResNet-18 (RN-18) [[25]](#b24), VGG-16 [[53]](#b52), DenseNet-121 (DN-121) [[29]](#b28), and WideResNet-34 (WRN-34) [[74]](#b73). For training these classifiers over different datasets and also training objectives (vanilla vs. adversarial training (AT)), we follow two different training conventions. The hyper-parameters of each setting are given in Table [II](#). Furthermore, Table [III](#) indicates the setting used for each experiment in the paper. c) Diffusion Models: For the diffusion models used during the denoising process of AVATAR (shown in Figure [2](#fig_0)), we follow the implementation of DiffPure[foot_1](#foot_1) and use score SDE [[58]](#b57) (for CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, IN-10) and the guided DDPM (for IN-100 and IN-1k-32×32.) [[11]](#b10). For CIFAR-10 and IN-100, we download the pre-trained versions available online. [3](#foot_2) for IN-1k-32×32 dataset. Additionally, for CIFAR-100, IN-10, and SVHN we use the PyTorch repository of score SDE [[58]](#b57), and train variance-preserving diffusion models with continuous DDPM++ architecture, similar to the one used for CIFAR-10. The FID score of the trained diffusion models is given in Table [IV](#).

d) Availability Attacks: We use seven SOTA availability attacks in our experiments: DeepConfuse (CON) [[15]](#b14), Neural Tangent Generalization Attacks (NTGA) [[72]](#b71), Errorminimizing Noise (EMN) [[30]](#b29), Targeted Adversarial Poisoning (TAP) [[17]](#b16), Robust EMN (REMN) [[18]](#b17), Shortcut (SHR) [[19]](#b18), and Autoregressive attacks (AR) [[50]](#b49). The details of each availability attack are given below:

• For CON [[15]](#b14), we use the released protected CIFAR-10 dataset, available online at SHR [[71]](#b70) repository. [4](#foot_3) Note that since generating this attack for the CIFAR-10 dataset would take 5-7 days, we just used the available data for CIFAR-10 and skipped generating the attack for the other datasets. • For NTGA [[72]](#b71), we use their code [5](#foot_4) to generate availability attacks for our datasets. For CIFAR-10, we used the data published online. For CIFAR-100 and SVHN, we used the online repository, and generate NTGA protected data using the CNN surrogate model, time-step of 64, and block-size of 100 to generate perturbations of magnitude ∥δ∥ ∞ ≤ 8/255. Due to limited GPU memory, we used the FNN surrogate model to generate perturbations of magnitude ∥δ∥ ∞ ≤ 0.1 for IN-100. The rest of the hyper-parameters were set similarly to CIFAR-100 and SVHN. • For EMN [[30]](#b29), TAP [[17]](#b16), and REMN [[18]](#b17), we use the online repository of REMN [6](#foot_5) which contains an implementation of EMN and TAP as well. We use the default CIFAR-10 configurations of this repository for CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN. For IN-10, we used the default MiniIN configurations of the REMN code-base. • Moreover, we use the SHR GitHub repository 4 to generate shortcut attacks. For CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN, we use the default settings. For IN-100, we use patchsize of 32 as advised by the authors. • Finally, we use the official data released on the AR GitHub repository for this attack. [7](#foot_6)A few samples for each availability attack are shown in Figure [7](#).

## B. Exploiting Protected Data

Table [V](#) shows our results for breaking availability attacks against for four different datasets. As can be seen, AVATAR can significantly improve the performance of neural network training in almost all cases. Moreover, although the training data was produced using diffusion models, the trained neural networks can generalize to unseen test data easily. This trend is more evident in the CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets where the pre-trained diffusion model can better represent the image data density, as indicated by their low FID scores.

## C. Comparison with Data Augmentation Techniques

AVATAR can be regarded as a type of data pre-processing where the inner mechanics of the learning algorithms are not modified. As such, here we compare our approach with various SOTA data augmentation techniques that can be utilized during model training. To this end, we follow the settings of [[30]](#b29), and adopt four widely used data augmentation techniques. In addition, we employ the JPEG and grayscale pre-processing [[38]](#b37) as well as two blurring techniques in Table [VI](#). Finally, we also test the quantization and total variation minimization (TVM) approaches that have shown to be effective against adversarial attacks [[24]](#b23). Table [VI](#) shows the performance of these methods compared to AVATAR. As shown, our approach outperforms various types of pre-processing/data augmentation methods.

## D. The Effect of Early Stopping

It has been previously shown that early stopping can also be beneficial against availability attacks [[30]](#b29). As such, here we run the same set of experiments over availability attacks for the CIFAR-10 dataset, but this time we record the highest accuracy attainable during training. Table [VII](#) shows our results. As seen, using our approach one achieves stable training, where the variance between the final model accuracy and the highest attainable accuracy is very low. Notably, while these results indicate that existing availability attacks are less powerful than what is thought, early stopping is not sufficient to recover the best model performance. In contrast, AVATAR can significantly cancel the effects of availability attacks.

## E. Comparison with Adversarial Training

As mentioned in Section II, adversarial training (AT) [[39]](#b38) is the most successful defense technique against availability attacks [[61]](#b60). For the next set of experiments, we follow the settings of Fu et al. [[18]](#b17) and compare our approach with AT. To this end, we run two different scenarios. First, we perform AT over the protected data. Then, we run AT over the data that is defused (i.e., counteracted) by AVATAR. In both cases, we vary the perturbation bound ε from 0 to 4, where 0 is the vanilla training. Figure [3](#) shows our results. Apart from what we discussed in Section III-D, two additional insights are worth mentioning here:

(1) In most cases, AVATAR without AT (i.e., ε = 0) performs on-par or better than AT with ε > 0. Thus, AVATAR delivers the SOTA against availability attacks. (2) As seen in Figure [3](#), AT yields the worst performance against REMN [[18]](#b17). However, our approach can combat REMN [[18]](#b17) successfully, and it is the first approach that does so.

## F. Setting Diffusion Step t *

As discussed in Section III-C, setting the diffusion timestep should be performed carefully. Otherwise, either the dataprotecting noise is not eliminated, or the semantic information of the image is lost. Here, we run an ablation study over the diffusion timestep. In particular, for our CIFAR-10 experiments, we run AVATAR with five different timesteps from {0, 100, 200, 300, 400}. Then, we measure the test accuracy of the trained neural networks over the clean test set. As shown in Figure [4](#fig_2), setting t * too small means that the data-protecting perturbations are not removed. In contrast, setting t * to a large value might remove the semantic information which in turn damages the generalizability of the trained model. For a more thorough discussion on selecting t * , please see Appendix B-C.

## G. The Effect of Diffusion Models' Training Data

It is well-known from the literature that diffusion models are not a mere memorization of their training data [[58]](#b57) and can further enhance the accuracy of down-stream tasks [[1,](#b0)[66]](#b65). To empirically eradicate the influence of training data overlap on our results, we perform the following experiment. Apart from our results in Table [V](#), we run a second set of experiments where we create disjoint subsets of training data for training diffusion models and those used as unlearnable examples. Then, we train our in-house diffusion model and perform a similar experiment to that of Table V, but this time with this new, non-overlapping set of data. Finally, we measure the performance over the unseen test data. We report the relative error rate with respect to the clean data performance in Figure [5](#fig_3). As seen, the overlap in diffusion models' training data has no impact on AVATAR's final performance. We further validate this through our real-world experiments in Section IV-I.

## H. Distribution Mismatch

To go even further, we show that AVATAR is even resilient to a distribution mismatch between the diffusion model and the training data. In particular, we train three diffusion models over the protected CIFAR-10 dataset with TAP [[17]](#b16), IN-10 which contains 10 classes of ImageNet that are most similar to CIFAR-10 dataset [[30]](#b29) (see Table [I](#)  TABLE V: Test accuracy (%) of RN-18 architectures trained over data availability attacks on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN, and ImageNet-100 datasets without and with our denoising approach. The mean and standard deviation are computed over 5 seeds. For our results over other architectures, please see Table X.

CIFAR-100. Then, we use these surrogate distributions to sanitize protected CIFAR-10 data and train a neural network over the denoised data. We report our results in Table [VIII](#). Surprisingly, our approach can tolerate the distribution mismatch to some extent. As the diffusion model density gets closer to the true training data, the performance gap is gradually closed. Interestingly, even using a diffusion model that is trained over protected data can be beneficial in removing the effects of availability attacks. Note that according to our threat model discussed in Figure [1](#), this case is too extreme, meaning that the data protector needs to add a perturbation to all the data on the web which is almost impossible. Interestingly, our method using the sub-optimal CIFAR-100 distribution is still performing better than grayscale and JPEG compression techniques of Liu et al. [[38]](#b37).

These results motivates us to run AVATAR in a real-world case. In particular, we employ the off-the-shelf diffusion model, DDPM-IP [[43]](#b42), that is trained over the 32 × 32 version of the ImageNet dataset in AVATAR. Then, we re-run our experiments of Table V on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN

As this DDPM-IP [[43]](#b42) uses a cosine schedule [[11]](#b10), we need to adjust the value of t * to reflect this change. As we discuss in Appendix B-C, we set t * = 200 to have an equivalent performance to the linear schedule that was used in our earlier experiments.

Our results are shown in Table [IX](#). As seen, AVATAR is resilient to the choice of the diffusion model. Even though there is a distribution mismatch between our test datasets and ImageNet-32×32, our results are on par with the use of the matching data distribution. These results indicate the realworld value of AVATAR which can serve as a strong baseline against availability attacks.

## I. Real-world Example I: Face Recognition

In Section I, we discussed in detail that the threat model of existing availability attacks is fragile and a malicious adversary might still exploit the personal data. This means that possibly no imperceptible adversary can protect the image data from being maliciously used. To show this, we discussed a realworld example in Section IV following a similar experiment from Huang et al. [[30]](#b29). In particular, we create a set of clean and protected identities in the WebFace [[69]](#b68) dataset by randomly selecting 50 identities from this dataset. As a result, the remaining 10522 identities constitute our clean data. For all of the identities, we randomly split the data so that 80% of that Distribution Data Availability Attacks CON NTGA EMN TAP REMN SHR AR Vanilla 15.75 ± 0.82 11.49 ± 0.69 24.85 ± 0.71 7.86 ± 0.90 20.50 ± 1.16 10.82 ± 0.22 12.09 ± 1.12 CIFAR-10 (TAP) 61.70 ± 2.02 75.62 ± 3.75 64.03 ± 0.98 35.09 ± 2.28 60.16 ± 1.44 74.96 ± 2.82 60.36 ± 2.29 IN-10 80.98 ± 0.06 79.42 ± 0.25 83.78 ± 0.39 82.71 ± 0.24 82.83 ± 0.28 75.91 ± 0.06 84.88 ± 0.19 CIFAR-100 84.85 ± 0.49 83.07 ± 0.33 87.81 ± 0.14 86.55 ± 0.26 85.84 ± 0.19 79.52 ± 0.22 88.59 ± 0.15 CIFAR-10 89.43 ± 0.09 87.95 ± 0.28 90.95 ± 0.10 90.71 ± 0.19 88.49 ± 0.24 85.69 ± 0.27 91.57 ± 0.18

Our approach uses a diffusion model trained over the CelebA [[37]](#b36) dataset. For all the stealthy data-protecting perturbations our approach manages to recover the performance over protected data. The only exception is SHR, which according to Figure [8](#), leaves a noticeable trace over the image, rendering them not useful anymore.

data is allocated to a training set and the rest is the test set. We assume that the protected identities would add data-protecting perturbations to their images before sharing them. To this end, we use class-wise EMN [[30]](#b29), TAP [[17]](#b16), REMN [[18]](#b17), and SHR [[71]](#b70) with a perturbation radius of ∥δ∥ ∞ ≤ 16/255. For perturbation generation using the first three attacks, we follow the settings of Huang et al. [[30]](#b29). Specifically, we select 100 random identities from the CelebA [[37]](#b36) dataset and create an auxiliary dataset consisting of these 100 identities and the 50 protected WebFace [[69]](#b68) identities. Then, using these 150 identities we generate data protecting perturbations against a neural network with 150 classes. For SHR, however, we generate the data for all the 10572 WebFace identities and select the relevant data for protecting our above-mentioned 50 identities. Once we have the protected data, we train an InceptionResNet [[59]](#b58) facial recognition over the training set with or without our approach and evaluate the models over the test set. In our case, we assume that the malicious entity has access to a pre-trained diffusion model over CelebA [[37]](#b36) faces [8](#foot_7) , and can run AVATAR over the protected data that it acquires from crawling the web. Since the WebFace photos are of size 112 × 112 but the diffusion model generates 256 × 256 images, we use bi-linear up-and down-sampling to connect the two. Like the CIFAR-10 experiments, here we also denoise the data with timestep set to 100. Samples of the WebFace dataset along with the protected data are shown in Figure [8](#).

To evaluate the performance of our method, we test the models over the clean test set and record the recognition accuracy for both the protected and clean identities. [9](#foot_8)As shown in Figure [6](#fig_4), AVATAR can recover the recognition accuracy over protected identities in all cases except the SHR [[71]](#b70) perturbations. The reason behind this might be twofold. First, we are using a sub-optimal diffusion model as both the domain and, more importantly, size of the images have a mismatch. Second, looking at Figure [8](#), we see that while the SHR perturbations can protect the data, they trade the stealthiness of the original data due to their large patches. As such, the images would lose their utility. Now, the question is:

Can we protect the data using stealthy patterns without losing the data utility?

Interestingly, our theoretical result in Theorem 1 says that this might not be possible. According to Theorem 1, if the data curator wants to makes the denoising process harder, they need to increase the data-protecting perturbation. This increase is naturally at odds with the data utility, since by adding more powerful perturbations we lose the data utility.

V. CONCLUSION In this paper, we introduced a countermeasure against data protection algorithms that use availability attacks. In particular, we show that by adding a controlled amount of Gaussian noise to the images and subsequently denoising them one can eliminate data-protecting perturbations. To this end, we use the forward and reverse diffusion processes of pre-trained models. We theoretically analyze our approach and show that the amount of Gaussian noise required to defuse the data-protecting perturbations is directly related to their norm. We conduct extensive experiments over various availability attacks. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to adversarial training, setting a new SOTA defense against availability attacks. AVATAR demonstrates brittleness of availability attacks and calls for more research to protect personal data. Future work involves investigating the applicability of AVATAR to other models such as text-to-image generative models [[52]](#b51) and its relationship with techniques such as randomized smoothing [[7]](#b6).

## The Devil's Advocate: Shattering the Illusion of Unexploitable Data using Diffusion Models APPENDIX A PROOFS

Here we provide our proof for Theorem 1. First, we provide the theoretical results that would be used in our proof. Then, we re-state Theorem 1 and provide its detailed proof. Our proofs heavily borrow from the contraction properties of stochastic difference equations [[44,](#b43)[45,](#b44)[6]](#b5).

Theorem 2 (Discrete stochastic contraction [[44,](#b43)[6]](#b5)). Let

$x t-1 = h(x t , t) + σ(x t , t)ϵ t ,(8)$denote a stochastic difference equation where:

(a) h : R d × N → R d is a contraction mapping, i.e., for every t ∈ N there exists a λ t ∈ [0, 1) such that

$∥h(x, t) -h(y, t)∥ ≤ λ t ∥x -y∥ ∀ x, y ∈ R d ,(9)$$(b) σ : R d × N → R is a function such that for every t ∈ N and x ∈ R d Tr σ(x, t)Iσ(x, t) ≤ C t ,(10)$(c) and ϵ t ∼ N (0, I).

Then, for two sample trajectories x t-1 and xt-1 that satisfy Equation (8) we have:

$E ∥x t-1 -xt-1 ∥ 2 ≤ λ 2 t E ∥x t -xt ∥ 2 + 2C t .(11)$Using Theorem 2 and Equation ( [5](#formula_4)) we can get the following result [[6]](#b5).

Corollary 2.1. The reverse diffusion process of DDPMs are contracting stochastic difference equations.

Proof. Our proof closely follows that of Chung et al. [[6]](#b5). Specifically, we need to show that for the reverse diffusion process given in Equation ( [5](#formula_4)), the conditions of Equations ( [9](#formula_13)) and ( [10](#formula_14)) hold. To show this, note that if we set:

$h(x t , t) = 1 √ 1 -β t (x t + β t s ϕ (x t , t))$and σ(x t , t) = β t then Equations ( [5](#formula_4)) and ( [8](#formula_12)) coincide. Using Lemma A.1. from Chung et al. [[6]](#b5), one can show that for

$λ t = 1 -β t 1 -α t-1 1 -α t(12)$and

$C t = dβ t (13$$)$the conditions of Equations ( [9](#formula_13)) and ( [10](#formula_14)) are satisfied. As such, for two reverse sample trajectories x t-1 and xt-1 that satisfy the reverse diffusion process of Equation ( [5](#formula_4)), Equation [(11)](#b10) holds.

Next, we present two lemmas that are going to be used in our proof of Theorem 1.

## Lemma 1 ([6]

). For λ t 's given in Equation (12) the following holds:

$t * s=1 λ 2 s ≤ exp(- t * β t * 2 ).(14)$Proof. See Lemma C.1. in [[6]](#b5).

Lemma 2. For two random vectors x and y we have:

$E ∥x + y∥ 2 ≤ 2 E ∥x∥ 2 + 2 E ∥y∥ 2 . (15$$)$Proof. We know that:

$E ∥x + y∥ 2 = E ∥x∥ 2 + E ∥y∥ 2 + 2 E x ⊤ y ≤ 2 E ∥x∥ 2 + 2 E ∥y∥ 2 ,$where the last inequality follows from the fact that E ∥x -y∥ 2 ≥ 0.

We are now ready to prove our theoretical result.

Theorem 1 (restated). Let x ∈ R d denote a clean image and x = x + δ its protected version, where δ denotes any arbitrary data protection perturbation. Also, let x0 be the sanitized image using the AVATAR denoising process given in Equations ( [6](#formula_5)) and [(7)](#b6). If we set t * such that

$2 log 2 ∥δ∥ 2 + 4d µ∆ ≤ t * β t * ≤ µ∆ 4d ,$then the estimation error between the sanitized x0 and clean image x can be bounded as:

$E ∥x 0 -x∥ 2 ≤ 2(µ + 1)∆,$where ∆ = E[∥x 0 -x∥ 2 ] and µ > 0 is a constant.

Proof. We are looking to find an upper-bound for the estimation error between the sanitized image and its clean version. Using Lemma 2 we can write:

$E ∥x 0 -x∥ 2 = E ∥(x 0 -x 0 ) + (x 0 -x)∥ 2 ≤ 2 E ∥x 0 -x 0 ∥ 2 + 2 E ∥x 0 -x∥ 2 ≤ 2 E ∥x 0 -x 0 ∥ 2 + 2 ∆.(16)$Now, we need to find an upper-bound for the first term. To this end, we are going to use the contraction property of the DDPMs (Corollary 2.1). In particular, given the noisy versions of the clean x and the protected image x = x + δ, in other words:

$x t * = √ α t * x + √ 1 -α t * ϵ 0 xt * = √ α t * x + √ 1 -α t * ϵ ′ 0 ,(17)$we know that both x 0 and x0 satisfy the reverse diffusion process, or:

$x t-1 = 1 √ 1 -$β t (x t + β t s ϕ (x t , t)) + β t ϵ t xt-1 = 1 √ 1 -β t (x t + β t s ϕ (x t , t)) + β t ϵ ′ t , ∀ t ∈ {1, 2, . . . , t * },

where ϵ t , ϵ ′ t ∼ N (0, I). As such, we can treat x 0 and x0 as two sample trajectories of the same stochastic difference equation. Thus, by recursively applying Equation [(11)](#b10) we would get:

$E ∥x 0 -x 0 ∥ 2 ≤ E ∥x t * -x t * ∥ 2 t * s=1 λ 2 s + 2 t * s=1 C s s-1 r=1 λ 2 r .(19)$Now, let us consider each term on the RHS of Equation ( [19](#formula_30)) separately. For the red term, we can write:

$E ∥x t * -x t * ∥ 2 (1) = E √ α t * (x -x) + √ 1 -α t * (ϵ ′ 0 -ϵ 0 ) 2 (2) = E √ α t * δ + √ 1 -α t * (ϵ ′ 0 -ϵ 0 ) 2 = ∥ √ α t * δ∥ 2 + E √ 1 -α t * (ϵ ′ 0 -ϵ 0 ) 2 + 2 √ α t * √ 1 -α t * δ ⊤ E [ϵ ′ 0 -ϵ 0 ] (3) = α t * ∥δ∥ 2 + (1 -α t * )E ∥(ϵ ′ 0 -ϵ 0 )∥ 2 . (20$$)$where ( [1](#formula_0)) is derived from Equation ( [17](#formula_27)), (2) holds since x = x + δ, and (3) is valid as ϵ 0 , ϵ ′ 0 ∼ N (0, I). Given that: ϵ ′ 0 -ϵ 0 ∼ N (0, 2I), we can simplify Equation [(20)](#b19) as:

$E ∥x t * -x t * ∥ 2 = α t * ∥δ∥ 2 + 2(1 -α t * )E [χ] ,$where χ follows the chi-squared distribution with d degrees of freedom. Using the fact that 0 < α t * < 1, we can finally write:

$E ∥x t * -x t * ∥ 2 = α t * ∥δ∥ 2 + 2(1 -α t * )d ≤ ∥δ∥ 2 + 2d.(21)$Using Lemma 1, for the blue term in Equation ( [19](#formula_30)) we can write:

$t * s=1 λ 2 s ≤ exp(- t * β t * 2 ).(22)$Finally, for the green term we have: 

Here, (1) is the result of Equation ( [13](#formula_18)), (2) holds since 0 < λ r < 1 (see Equation ( [12](#formula_17))), and ( [3](#formula_2)) is derived from

$0 < β 1 < • • • < β t < 1.$Putting Equations ( [21](#formula_34)) to ( [23](#formula_36)) together, we have:

$E ∥x 0 -x 0 ∥ 2 ≤$∥δ∥ 2 + 2d exp(-t * β t * 2 ) + 2dt * β t * . (24) Given that: 2 log 2 ∥δ∥ 2 + 4d µ∆ ≤ t * β t * ≤ µ∆ 4d , we can simplify Equation (24) as: E ∥x 0 -x 0 ∥ 2 ≤ ∥δ∥ 2 + 2d exp(-t * β t * 2 ) + 2dt * β t * ≤ ∥δ∥ 2 + 2d µ∆ 2 ∥δ∥ 2 + 4d + 2d µ∆ 4d ≤ µ∆.

Replacing Equation [(25)](#b24) into Equation ( [16](#formula_26)), the proof can be completed.

![Fig. 5: Relative error rate of RN-18 models trained against availability attacks on CIFAR-10 and SVHN averaged over 5 runs. Overlapping indicates that the diffusion model and availability attacks use the same subset as training data. Non-overlapping means that the diffusion model and availability attacks are trained on disjoint subsets of data. TABLE VIII: Test accuracy (%) of RN-18 models trained over data availability attacks on the CIFAR-10 dataset. For AVATAR, we use different pre-trained distributions over CIFAR-10, poisoned CIFAR-10 (TAP), ImageNet-10 (IN-10) [30], and CIFAR-100. The results are averaged over 5 runs.]()

Our approach uses a diffusion model trained over the CelebA[37] dataset. For all the stealthy data-protecting perturbations our approach manages to recover the performance over protected data. The only exception is SHR, which according to Figure8, leaves a noticeable trace over the image, rendering them not useful anymore.]()

Note that while here we use DDPMs[[28]](#b27) to demonstrate our method, it can be easily extended to other types of diffusion models as they are all different ways of representing the same process[[58]](#b57).

ForCIFAR-10, we used the checkpoint for the vp/cifar10_ddpmpp_deep_continuous setting on score SDE repository: https://github.com/yang-song/score sde pytorch. Moreover, we used the unconditional 256 × 256 model available on the guided DDPM code-base for IN-100 expriments: https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion. Finally, we use the pre-trained DDPM-IP[[43]](#b42) models available on https://github.com/forever208/DDPM-IP

For this experiment, we use a pre-trained DDPM model over CelebA-HQ: https://github.com/ermongroup/SDEdit.

Running the identity overlap removal of Wang et al.[[65]](#b64), we found that only 8 out of 50 protected identities had overlap between CelebA-HQ and WebFace. After removing these identities, we saw no major drop in the final performance of AVATAR.
