- **Objective**: Enforce strict schema adherence in LLM outputs for regulated domains (e.g., bio-manufacturing).
  
- **Key Framework**: DeepSeek R1 reinforcement learning framework, utilizing Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

- **Model Details**: 
  - Base model: 1.5B parameter model.
  - Training duration: ~20 hours on 8Ã—H100 GPU cluster for GRPO; ~3 hours on 1xA100 for supervised fine-tuning (SFT).

- **Datasets**:
  - **Unstructured to Structured**: 20K sample dataset for core reasoning abilities.
  - **Reasoning Sample**: 10K dataset for refining schema adherence.

- **Performance Comparison**: 
  - ThinkJSON vs. DeepSeek R1 (671B), Qwen-1.5B, Qwen-7B, Gemini 2.0 Flash (70B).
  - Demonstrated robust performance in schema consistency.

- **Challenges**: 
  - LLMs generate text probabilistically, risking schema violations (e.g., missing fields, incorrect formats).
  - Empirical success rates for JSON generation vary widely (0% to 100%).

- **Approaches to Schema Adherence**:
  - **Supervised Fine-Tuning**: Requires domain-specific data; resource-intensive.
  - **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)**: Aligns LLMs with human preferences; requires extensive feedback data.
  - **Constraint-Based Decoding**: Guarantees schema adherence; may introduce complexity and latency.
  - **Prompt Engineering**: Accessible but requires manual effort; inconsistent results possible.
  - **Hybrid Methods**: Combine prompt engineering with constraint-based decoding for improved adherence.

- **Methodology**:
  - **Synthetic Data Construction**: Generate unstructured and structured data pairs for training.
  - **Custom Reward Mechanisms**: Evaluate adherence to schema while balancing fluency and correctness.
  - **Training Process**: 
    - Train R1-Zero model using RL and synthetic datasets.
    - Fine-tune R1-Zero into R1 with supervised fine-tuning.

- **Data Generation**:
  - Create multi-level JSON schemas and corresponding filled JSON objects.
  - Generate unstructured text that reflects filled schemas in various formats.

- **Example Prompt for Data Generation**:
  - "You are an expert in building a hierarchical JSON schema for the domain {DOMAIN}. Your task is to create a multi-level JSON Schema..."

- **Key Considerations**:
  - Ensure outputs are valid, parseable, and aligned with downstream requirements.
  - Address the balance between technical accuracy and compliance in regulated industries.
