  "abstract": "Researchers have argued that large language models (LLMs) exhibit\nhigh-quality writing capabilities from blogs to stories. However, evaluating\nobjectively the creativity of a piece of writing is challenging. Inspired by\nthe Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT), which measures creativity as a\nprocess, we use the Consensual Assessment Technique [3] and propose the\nTorrance Test of Creative Writing (TTCW) to evaluate creativity as a product.\nTTCW consists of 14 binary tests organized into the original dimensions of\nFluency, Flexibility, Originality, and Elaboration. We recruit 10 creative\nwriters and implement a human assessment of 48 stories written either by\nprofessional authors or LLMs using TTCW. Our analysis shows that LLM-generated\nstories pass 3-10X less TTCW tests than stories written by professionals. In\naddition, we explore the use of LLMs as assessors to automate the TTCW\nevaluation, revealing that none of the LLMs positively correlate with the\nexpert assessments.",
